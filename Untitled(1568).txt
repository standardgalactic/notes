"He Was Given a Taste of His Own Poison in the Bull He Himself Commissioned: The Brazen Bull of Phalaris"

This device's name refers to Phalaris, a tyrant who ruled in the 6th century BC in the ancient city-state of Acragas, now known as Agrigento (Sicily). His sound judgment in governance allowed the city to experience a period of wealth and prosperity. However, Phalaris was far from being a saint… and was far from being considered a good person. In fact, the tyrant was known for his extreme cruelty and his “creativity” when executing the condemned. It was even said that he practiced cannibalism and had a special taste for small children.

On one occasion, Phalaris contacted Perillus of Athens, a skilled sculptor, blacksmith, and inventor of recognized prestige in the city, to build him a new torture machine, whose cruelty and savagery would instill terror in the hearts of his enemies (and anyone who dared contradict him).

Perillus found an elegant solution to the problem posed by Phalaris: his proposal was basically a hollow copper statue in the shape of a bull. At the time of carrying out the sentence, a compartment on the side of the figure was opened, and the condemned was placed inside the bull. Finally, a great fire was lit under the device. The metal turned red-hot... and ended up roasting the victim alive. The smoke from their burnt flesh and the sound of their screams came out as bellowing through a pair of holes that its creator had left in the bull’s nose.

Phalaris was excited about his new “toy”... although he still remained skeptical of its effectiveness. Perillus had set the bar very high, and the tyrant wanted to know if the device would really meet his expectations. True to the reputation he had earned, Phalaris decided to use Perillus as a test subject, so he ordered that he be thrown inside the bull to die roasted.

As some chronicles of the time explain, the creator of the “Brazen Bull of Phalaris” was not the only one who suffered its torment, as Phalaris himself also had to endure it. In 554 BC, a popular uprising ended his reign... and his life. Apparently, the enraged mob threw the tyrant into his own bull to die cooked and to hear his bellows.
