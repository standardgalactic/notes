He devised a classification system of planar linkages with lower pairs based on the theory of mechanisms. This system turned out to be remarkably productive, as it described not only all of the hinge mechanisms known at that time, but also showed how to form the new ones. After Assur’s death, his ideas were further developed in the works of his fellow Russian and foreign researchers.
