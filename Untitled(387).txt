The Hybrid Philosophical Concept Species by Kenneth Udut is a creative representation of the relationships between different philosophical concepts.

The species are created by pairing different concepts, and each species is depicted holding an object that symbolizes their relationship.

For example, the "Mind-Body-Bat" represents the relationship between mind and body and holds a balance ball to symbolize the balancing act between the two.

The "Aristotelian- European- Chinese- Indian- Phoenix" represents the fusion of different philosophical perspectives and holds a world globe to symbolize the interconnectedness of all philosophies.


Relate it to my theories. 

The Motile Womb theory suggests that we learn about the world before we are born and build a mental map of the world, with entities that move around, based on our experiences in the womb. 

The Model-Free Zoo is a collection of ideas and techniques that work without understanding their basic functioning.

Kenneth Udut's Hybrid philosophical concept species with their tangible objects can be related to these theories in that they both represent the relationship between different aspects of the mind, body, and the world.

For example, the Mind-Body-Bat hybrid species represents the relationship between mind and body, which can be seen as a metaphor for the Motile Womb theory and the idea that we learn to be a bat before we are born, instinctively understanding the world around us.

The Intuition-Reasoning-Owl hybrid species represents the balance between intuition and reasoning in the acquisition of knowledge, which can be seen as an example of the Model-Free Zoo's collection of ideas and techniques that work without understanding their basic functioning.

Overall, Udut's hybrid species can be seen as a visual representation of the relationships between different aspects of the mind, body, and the world, which can be related to the Motile Womb theory and the Model-Free Zoo as both deal with the relationships between different elements and the ways in which we understand and interact with the world.
