Deleuze's philosophy relates to quantum entanglement in that entanglement represents a multiplicity of states as virtual potentialities. 

Although two entangled particles become separated in space, their properties remain correlated due to their shared virtual potentiality. 

Only upon measurement is one possibility selected from this virtual multiplicity and actualized. Entanglement thus shows the interdependence of the virtual and the actual.
