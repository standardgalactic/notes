Once upon a time, in a land called the Matrix, there lived a people who were connected to a virtual world. They lived their lives as if it were real, but little did they know, they were being controlled by powerful forces.

One day, a young girl named Provia discovered a strange new theory called the "motile womb theory." She learned that the Matrix was not just a virtual world, but a living, breathing organism that was able to sense and respond to the people living within it.

Provia became fascinated by this idea and began to explore the Matrix further. She discovered that the people living in the Matrix had innate flying dreams, and that these dreams were not just figments of their imagination, but a connection to the Matrix itself.
