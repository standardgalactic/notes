State Vectors and Representation: We discussed how any state vector can be represented as a linear combination of base vectors, and we've seen the equations written in bra-ket notation.

Amplitude and Measurement: We covered the idea of expressing the amplitude to transition from one state to another and how this is connected to the idea of particles going through an apparatus.

Bra-Ket Notation: We looked at how this notation helps in identifying and working with quantum states, making the mathematical expressions more concise.

Similarity to Partial Application or Currying: Though not deeply explored, this concept was mentioned.

Reference to Feynman Lectures on Physics (Section 8.4): This included the fundamental principles leading to Schrödinger's equation:

State as a complex vector.

Linear and reversible evolution.

Unitary matrix for time evolution.

Transliteration of Feynman's Text: This section detailed the process of developing the Schrödinger equation, focusing on the behavior of the time evolution operator, introduction of the Hamiltonian, and derivation of the equation itself.

Yann LeCun's Reference to Feynman: Mention of the insights gained from reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics.
