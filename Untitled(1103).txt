SpherepopÂ - A 3D programming language where you grow bubbles from seed and each nested sphere represents a node in an abstract syntax tree, and you evaluate functions and run programs by popping bubbles.


We started by discussing the impact of a researcher's measurement choice on performance.

Then we talked about Spherepop, a hypothetical 3D programming language where programs are written by growing bubbles and evaluated by popping them.

We then shifted to discussing Haplopraxis, a space exploration and typing tutor game. The goal of the game is to explore planets by flying a spaceship and popping bubbles associated with vocabulary words.

You lose all your points if the game is reset, except if you are blinking, which can be enabled with autoblink or super autoblink.

The global reset key is 'g'.

Finally, we clarified some of the details about the game, including the controls for flying the spaceship and the mechanics of popping bubbles and avoiding resets.
