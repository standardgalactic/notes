Did Da Vinci discover gravity?

No, Leonardo da Vinci did not discover gravity. The concept of gravity was first described by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century. Da Vinci lived in the 15th and 16th centuries and made many important contributions to fields such as art, engineering, and anatomy, but he did not discover gravity. However, he did conduct some experiments on the movement of water and air, and he studied the motion of falling objects.

Some of his observations and ideas may have influenced later thinkers who contributed to the development of the theory of gravity, but he did not make the discovery himself.
