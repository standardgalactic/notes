In this chapter, the author argues that if materialism is true and we accept consciousness in rabbits and other alien beings with similar cognitive and behavioral sophistication, then we are also justified in attributing consciousness to spatially distributed entities like Sirian supersquids and Antarean antheads. The author uses examples of these entities to illustrate that they have the necessary organization and coherence to be evaluated for the presence or absence of consciousness. The United States is also considered as a planet-sized alien entity, which is argued to meet the criteria for consciousness if standard materialist criteria are applied without prejudice. The chapter challenges the notion that brains are special in giving rise to conscious experience and emphasizes the importance of information processing and environmental responsiveness.
