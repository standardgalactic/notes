The arena in which thoughts develop.

Who knows what schools will be like 25 years from now, or 50?

In time, the type of student that is currently a failure may be considered a success, the type who is now successful may be regarded as a handicap learner, slow to respond, too detached, lacking in emotion, inadequate in crafting mental pictures of reality.

A Digital Hemispheric Divide

In introducing the personal computer to the classroom, we shall be breaking a four-hundred-year-old truce between the gregariousness and openness fostered by orality, and the introspection and isolation fostered by the printed word.

Orality stresses group learning, co-operation, and a sense of social responsibility, which is the context within which Thamus believed proper and real knowledge must be communicated.

Print emphasizes individualized learning, competition, and personal autonomy.

Over four centuries teachers --while emphasizing print — have allowed orality it's place in the classroom and therefore have a achieved a kind of pedagogical peace between these two forms of learning, so that what is valuable in each can be maximized.

Now comes the computer, carrying anew the banner of private learning and individual problem-solving.

Will the widespread use of computers in the classroom defeat once and for all the claims of communal speech?

Will the computer raise egocentricism to the status of a virtue?

Will technological competition ignite total war, making it impossible to contain the effects of a new technology to a limited sphere of human activity.

If this metaphor puts the matter too brutally, we might try a gentler, kinder one:

Technological change is neither additive nor subtractive, it is ecological — one significant change generates total change.
