the main points of General semantics according to science and sanity

General Semantics is a field of study developed by Alfred Korzybski in the early 20th century. The main points of General Semantics, as presented in Korzybski's book "Science and Sanity," include:

1. The structure of language influences our perception and understanding of the world.
2. Words and language are not a direct representation of reality, but rather a map or model of it.
3. Human beings have the unique ability to be aware of their own thinking processes, known as "consciousness of abstracting."
4. Human knowledge is limited and fallible, and it is important to be aware of the limits of our own understanding.
5. The use of non- Aristotelian logic, which allows for the understanding of the complexity and uncertainty of the world.
6. The importance of understanding the difference between "is of identity" and "is of predication"
7. The importance of understanding the concept of time-binding and how it allows for the accumulation of knowledge and progress.
8. The importance of understanding the concept of "multiordinality" and how words can have different meanings in different contexts.
9. The importance of understanding the concept of "extensional devices" and how they can help to clarify meaning and reduce confusion.
10. The importance of being aware of and avoiding "semantic reactions" or automatic, habitual ways of thinking and responding.

These are some of the main points of General Semantics, as presented in "Science and Sanity" and it's important to note that General Semantics is a complex field of study that encompasses many other concepts and ideas.
