Error, edit not published.

Your edit was not saved because it contains a new external link to a site registered on Wikipedia's blacklist or Wikimedia's global blacklist.

To save your changes now, you must go back and remove the blocked link (shown below), and then save.

Note that if you used a redirection link or URL shortener (like e.g. goo.gl, t.co, youtu.be, bit.ly), you may still be able to save your changes by using the direct, non-shortened link - you generally obtain the non-shortened link by following the link, and copying the contents of the address bar of your web-browser after the page has loaded.

Links containing google.com/url? are resulting from a copy/paste from the result page of a Google search - please follow the link on the result page, and copy/paste the contents of the address bar of your web-browser after the page has loaded, or click here to convert the link.

If you feel the link is needed, you can:

Request that the entire website be allowed, that is, removed from the local or global spam blacklists (check both lists to see which one is affecting you).

Request that just the specific page be allowed, without unblocking the whole website, by asking on the spam whitelist talk page.

Blacklisting indicates past problems with the link, so any requests should clearly demonstrate how inclusion would benefit Wikipedia. The following link has triggered a protection filter: everybodywiki.com
Either that exact link, or a portion of it (typically the root domain name) is currently blocked.

Solutions:

If the URL used is a URL shortener/redirect, please use the full URL in its place, for example, use youtube.com rather than youtu.be,

If the URL is a Google URL, please look to use the (full) original source, not the Google shortcut or its alternative.

Look to find an alternative URL that is considered authoritative.
