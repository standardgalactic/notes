No, they don’t, because it doesn’t tell you anything that you don’t already know.

It’s easy to multiply two numbers the old-fashioned way, but virtually impossible if you try to do so using FOL.

And if you do use FOL to find the answer to some problem, you won’t know that it gave you the right answer unless you already know the answer.

Plus, the intellectual resources needed to convert even the most elementary math problems into FOL vastly exceed the resources needed to solve those problems on their own terms.

There is also the fact that any given system of logic, being a recursively generated statement-set, is ipso facto undefined with respect to non-recursive sets—and is therefore undefined with respect to all but a vanishingly small subset of the set of mathematical propositions.

FOL is an attempt to identify existing forms of mathematical reasoning.

It’s a theory, in other words.

And it’s not a very good one, as we’ve just seen.

The same goes for ‘modal logic’ and all of the other FOL-spinoffs.

These are garbage disciplines.
