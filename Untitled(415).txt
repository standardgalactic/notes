Hmm I think I can partially answer that.

It sounds like you are thinking about minimal functional completeness. The only functionally complete operators (universal gates) are Nand and Nor (the Apollo computers were made using only Nor gates, https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digital_Circuits/NOR_Logic)

If you want a functionally complete system with 2 operators, using XOR you need an If then (imply) or converse implication gate as well. Of the 26 functionally complete systems only 6 use XOR, because you can can equivalent functionally by chaining other gates.

For example, you could simulate XOR with just ORs, ANDs, and NOT like this:

A ↮ B = (A ∨ B ) ∧ ¬(A ∧ B )

Or like this:

A ↮ B = ( A ∧ B ) ∨ (¬A ∧ B )

(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or)

Using three operators you could use XOR and IFF  and an OR or an AND, or XOR and TOP and an AND or an OR.

I asked GPT for the 16 logical operator, but it got it wrong.  They should have been and ∧, or ∨, xor ↮, if then (implication) →, converse implication ←,  equivalence ↔, nand ↑, nor ↓, but not (nimply, nonimplication↛, converse nonimplication ↚, 
top (tautology) ⊤, bottom (contradiction) ⊥, A, B, not A ¬A, not B ¬B

Good luck trying to type any of that, it seems no one can agree on the correct symbols.

Human:
WHAT ARE THE 16 logical operators for a Boolean calculus of two variables? 

AI:
The sixteen logical operators in the Boolean calculus of two variables are: 
AND: A ∧ B 
OR: A ∨ B 
XOR: A ⊕ B 
NOT: ¬A 
IMPLICATION: A → B 
CONVERSE IMPLICATION: A ← B 
EQUIVALENCE: A ≡ B 
NAND: A ↑ B 
NOR: A ↓ B 
EXCLUSIVE-OR: A ⊻ B 
CONVERSE 
EXCLUSIVE-OR: A △ B 
IFF: A <→ B 
COMPLEMENT: A ⌐ B 
CONVERSE COMPLEMENT: A ◊ B 
EQUIVALENT: A = B
