Marshall McLuhan is probably best known for coining the phrase “The medium is the message.”

The transfer of a message not only includes the information itself but also information concerning the medium used.

The medium sends implied information. As an example, sending a real analog greeting card sends the implied message that the recipient was worth the effort of a rather involved EF process involving planning, thoughtfulness, cost (time and money), appropriateness, etc.

McLuhan asserts that tools (especially communication tools) are really extensions of our bodies. Such extensions also include extensions of the mind.

A new technology “produces a new kind of human being” (quoting Powers).

Using McLuhan’s work as a backdrop, Powers states: “If our technologies are driving us nuts, it’s our fault for not paying attention to what they’re doing to us.”

Powers gives us this “showstopper” statement: “Attention deficit issues, Internet addiction, and other tech-related maladies are all about being stuck in [going out] gear.” Simply, there’s no returning home, to self, to body. It’s a perpetual state of discorporation or mind separate from body.
