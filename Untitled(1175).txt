Yo I saw your email. Sorry I didn't answer you on the mural, I am super busy with construction projects, it didn't sound very interesting to design, like maybe it was too open ended. Building some decks and sheds and I think maybe build a house for my aunt this summer.

Am live painting at future forest this fall, but have like ten thousand ideas. I think I have new problems trying to not accidentally take over the world, I am worried almost everything I can think to publish seems too controversial without enough context, although of course I think it is all innocuous.

Last year I brought enough material to paint ten thousand painting like literally dozens of rolls of vinyl, but I had zero ideas.

So I painted like five or six. I am a little worried though about painting that many paintings in a weekend, I don't want to break any world records, but sometimes it can't be helped.
