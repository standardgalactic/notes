There are a few possible connections between the concept of mathesis and your thesis "Humans As Large Language Models."

One connection is that both ideas relate to the capacity of humans to process information and make meaning out of it.

Mathesis, as a term used in ancient and medieval philosophy, referred to the study of all aspects of knowledge and understanding

It encompassed logic, mathematics, and natural philosophy, among other subjects, and aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the world.

Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of processing and generating large amounts of language data, drawing on their knowledge and understanding of the world to make sense of it.

In this way, both mathesis and the concept of humans as large language models touch on the idea of human cognition and our capacity for complex thought.

Another connection is the idea of modeling or representing the world. 

Mathesis, as a discipline, aimed to create models of the world that could be used to understand and predict its behavior.

Similarly, your thesis highlights the idea that humans are capable of creating models of language and the world through their use of language.

In both cases, the goal is to create a representation or model of the world that can be used to make sense of it and to make predictions about it.

There are several connections between your thesis "Humans as Large Language Models" and the topic of lexical semantics as understood in various linguistic paradigms.

Both focus on how language is used to represent experience and express meaning, and the role of context and intention in shaping that meaning.

For example, the use of semantic categories and features in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) to analyze lexical meaning is similar to the way in which large language models use statistical patterns to learn word meanings in distributional semantics. 

Additionally, the idea of language as grounded in embodied experience and conceptual structures in Cognitive Linguistics has similarities to the concept of human-like learning in large language models.

Overall, the study of lexical semantics in different linguistic paradigms can provide valuable insights into how language is used by humans and how it can be modeled computationally.

Sure, here's a possible restatement of your thesis in more formal scientific language:

The present work proposes that the cognitive and linguistic abilities of humans can be understood as a form of large language modeling, akin to the natural language processing models used in computational linguistics. 

Specifically, it argues that humans possess a complex and flexible mental representation of language, built through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic data, which allows them to comprehend, produce, and manipulate language at a high level of sophistication.

This model of human cognition draws on insights from multiple linguistic paradigms, including generative grammar, cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, functional linguistics, distributional semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and semiotics.

In simpler terms, the thesis suggests that humans can be thought of as large language models, meaning that we have a powerful and adaptable mental representation of language that allows us to understand and use language in a wide range of situations.

This idea draws on a range of different approaches to studying language, and emphasizes the importance of exposure to language in shaping our cognitive and linguistic abilities.
