Bayesian Inference on General Riemannian Manifolds using Geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo

Given observed data �1,...,��∈��y1​,...,yN​∈Rn, a generative model can be described using a likelihood function �(�∣�)p(y∣q). In this context, �∈��q∈Mm represents an �m-dimensional vector on a manifold that parameterizes the likelihood.
