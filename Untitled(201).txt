اللّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ

Allahu la ilaha illa huwa alhayyu alqayyoomu

Here's where it says Allah is YHWH (in the Qur'an)

"Thou shalt not fear any God but The Ever Living, the Self-Sustaining Source."

Actually it just says:
Do not worship the Moon
But the Living Source

Literally:
the moon not but except
he the living the source
