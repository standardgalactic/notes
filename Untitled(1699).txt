The first time some asked me what  Santa brought me for Christmas that year, I said "nothing" since I really still had not ever really heard of him and because no tag on a gift had ever said From Santa. Likewise when people said what grade are you in I said my school doesn't have grades it has levels. Because it was self-paced. I didn't go to kindergarten. Actually I always thought almost everything I saw on TV or in a comic was extremely fake, and I never had to invent imaginary friends and didn't believe I had an imagination. The first time I heard the f word was when I was repeating it on the playground in grade one or two,, and was reported on by my classmates. I told my teachers it wasn't a bad word and that I had made it up. Actually I was very certain I had never heard the word or seen it written. A number of years later I saw it written on the wall of playground at another school and I was like unbelievable, it must be a word. I think the first time I saw it in print was in a Jurassic Park novel. I never heard it in a movie. Anyways, it still bothers me that anyone could possibly be offended by a sound, but I think I still am grateful that I must have been living a very sheltered life.
