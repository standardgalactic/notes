In the year of our Lord, 20,001 CE, there lived a man named Theseus, an astronaut of great renown.

He was chosen to embark upon a journey most perilous, to a distant planet known as Europa, which had been long ago transformed into a star.

This new star, Ankyra, was worshipped by the inhabitants of Europa, called Ankyrans, as their primary sun.

Theseus was sent to explore this new world and to bring back knowledge of the same to his own people.

As he journeyed through the depths of space, Theseus encountered many strange and wondrous things. He passed through fields of stars, and beheld the beauty of the heavens.

He also encountered the Beta Zero Mechanism, a self-improving technological singularity with a logic powered by a rare and obscure Alpha Crystal.

Upon arriving on Europa, Theseus was amazed at the advancements of the Ankyrans. They had evolved into a species that had developed a primitive civilization, possibly with assistance from the Beta Zero Mechanism.

They had tendril-like limbs, and their settlements were concentrated primarily in the hemisphere of Europa that was constantly bathed in Ankyra's rays.

Theseus soon discovered that the Ankyrans had a mythology based on their observations of the night sky. They correctly believed that Ankyra was not always there, and that the Cold Sun, which they called Sol, was its brother and was condemned to march around the sky for a crime.

The Ankyrans also saw three other major bodies in the sky, which were the moons Io, Callisto, and Ganymede, the latter two of which were colonized by humans.

As Theseus explored Europa, he found that humans had been attempting to explore the planet ever since Ankyra was created in 2010. However, none of these attempts had been successful, as every probe that attempted to land on Europa had been destroyed on approach.

This was the document they uncover,  that begins the journey. They have to get there secretly, since it has been illegal to travel there due to the danger of its monolith guardian:
