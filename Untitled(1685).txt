The article "On the Compresence of Tropes" by Arda Denkel was published in the journal Philosophy and Phenomenological Research in September 1997. The article is eight pages long and was published by the International Phenomenological Society.

The abstract of the article provides an overview of its content. It begins by discussing the question of how properties, or tropes, cohere in bundles when objects are understood as bundles of tropes. The paper explores three possible explanations for the cohesion of tropes: a substratum, external relations, or internal relations. The first two options are eliminated as implausible, and the paper argues in favor of the third option.

The main thesis proposed in the article is that tropes are held in compresence by appropriately qualified internal relations, which avoids the consequence that such properties would be essential to the object. The article aims to provide a plausible account of how alteration is possible in an object whose particular properties hold together through qualified internal relations.

The article also mentions Peter Simons and his discussion of alternative answers to the question of how properties cohere in bundles. Simons criticizes explanations based on external relations and substrata. The objections include the large number of relations involved in external bonding and the difficulties in accounting for motion. Simons argues that the notion of a substratum is inconsistent because it would be essential for bare particulars to have no properties and be limited to one substance at a time.

The reference to rejecting theories of cohesion based on external bonds and substrata suggests that the article discusses various perspectives on the topic and presents arguments against them.
