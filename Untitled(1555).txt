Who's that? Sit down, Navigator.

Are you the one that's been calling me? Affirmative.

You have the information I require to complete my mission.

Sit down!

I think there's been some sort of mistake.

I do not make mistakes. Awaiting final vectors.

Vectors? I don't have any vectors, I'm just a kid.

That is obvious.

But your brain has been programmed with all appropriate star charts.

You mean, that's why my brain has been coming up with all that stuff?

Yes.

You are the Navigator!
