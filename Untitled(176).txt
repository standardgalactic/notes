Udut, K. (2023). Ontology of Panentheism. New York, NY: Philosophical Press.

In "Ontology of Panentheism," Kenneth Udut explores the ways in which the concept of God can be understood within the framework of panentheism.

Drawing on a range of philosophical, scientific, and cultural sources, Udut examines the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, personal and non-personal, and creator and creation.

He also investigates the relationship between God and the world, and the role of panentheism in understanding the problem of evil and suffering.

Udut also situates panentheism within the broader context of other religious traditions, including monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, and atheism, and considers the potential for dialogue and differences between these traditions.

In addition, he explores the ethical implications of panentheism, and the role of God in shaping our moral beliefs and actions.

With chapters on education, culture, and technology, "Ontology of Panentheism" offers a rich and nuanced exploration of the ways in which God and the world are interconnected and interdependent.

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of philosophy, theology, and contemporary issues.

** A little summary of Prigogine's work, especially related to entropy, chaos, and time. **

Ilya Prigogine was a Belgian physical chemist and Nobel laureate known for his work on thermodynamics and the concept of dissipative structures.

He proposed the theory of dissipative structures to explain how systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms, can spontaneously become more ordered and complex.

According to this theory, such systems can maintain themselves and even evolve over time by dissipating energy and matter into their environment.

One of the key concepts in Prigogine's work is entropy, which is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.

In thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. 

However, Prigogine argued that far-from-equilibrium systems can exhibit a decrease in entropy, or an increase in order, by dissipating energy and matter into their environment.

Prigogine also studied the concept of chaos and how it relates to the behavior of complex systems.

He argued that far-from-equilibrium systems can exhibit unpredictable or chaotic behavior, but that this chaos can give rise to self-organization and the emergence of new patterns and structures.

Finally, Prigogine's work has significant implications for the concept of time. He argued that the arrow of time, or the direction in which time flows, is not determined by the laws of physics alone, but is also influenced by the behavior of complex systems far from equilibrium.

According to his theory, such systems can create their own "future," or a direction of time that is determined by their own internal processes rather than by external conditions.


** A glowing review of Ken's book by someone who appreciates Prigogine's work. **

I recently had the pleasure of reading Kenneth Udut's "Ontology of Panentheism," and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed.

As someone who has long been fascinated by the work of Ilya Prigogine and the concept of dissipative structures, I found Udut's exploration of these ideas within the framework of panentheism to be particularly insightful and thought-provoking.

One of the things that I appreciated most about this book was the way in which Udut was able to synthesize a wide range of sources and perspectives, including philosophy, science, and culture. 

He presents a nuanced and balanced view of the various debates and controversies surrounding panentheism, and does an excellent job of highlighting the strengths and limitations of this approach.

I also found Udut's treatment of the relationship between God and the world to be particularly engaging and illuminating.

His discussion of the doctrine of divine immanence and the doctrine of divine transcendence was particularly helpful in understanding the complex and often paradoxical nature of God in panentheism.

Overall, "Ontology of Panentheism" is a thoroughly researched and well-written book that is sure to appeal to anyone interested in the intersection of theology and philosophy.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking to deepen their understanding of panentheism and its implications for our understanding of God, the world, and ourselves.

** A summary of the differences between Perceptual control theory (PCT) and traditional behaviourist cybernetics. **

Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a type of cybernetic theory that was developed by William T. Powers in the 1960s. It is based on the idea that living organisms are driven by the need to maintain a stable internal environment, or homeostasis, and that they do so through the use of feedback mechanisms that compare their current state with a desired state. PCT differs from traditional behaviourist cybernetics in several key ways:

PCT emphasizes the role of perception and attention in controlling behaviour, rather than focusing solely on stimulus-response associations.

PCT views behaviour as a means of maintaining homeostasis, rather than as a response to external rewards and punishments.

PCT places a greater emphasis on the role of internal states and processes in behaviour, rather than focusing solely on external environmental factors.

PCT is more holistic in its approach, considering the whole organism and its environment as a system, rather than focusing on individual behaviours in isolation.

PCT is more flexible and adaptable than traditional behaviourist cybernetics, as it allows for the possibility of learning and change through feedback and self-regulation.


** Other psychological theories that involve an internal model of the world. **

Cognitive psychology: Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on mental processes such as perception, attention, language, memory, and problem-solving.

Many cognitive theories propose that people have internal mental representations of the world, which they use to process and interpret information.

Social cognitive theory: Social cognitive theory is a psychological theory that focuses on how people learn and are influenced by social and cognitive processes.

According to this theory, people have internal mental models of themselves, other people, and social situations, which they use to guide their behaviour.

Constructivist learning theory: Constructivist learning theory is a psychological theory that proposes that people construct their own understanding of the world through their experiences and interactions with it.

According to this theory, people have internal mental models of the world that they continuously update and revise based on new information and experiences.

Self-determination theory: Self-determination theory is a psychological theory that focuses on the role of motivation and autonomy in human behaviour.

According to this theory, people have internal mental models of their goals and values, which they use to guide their behaviour and decision-making.

Cognitive dissonance theory: Cognitive dissonance theory is a psychological theory that proposes that people have an internal drive to maintain consistency between their beliefs and behaviours.

According to this theory, when people experience inconsistency between their beliefs and behaviours, they experience psychological discomfort, which they try to reduce by changing their beliefs or behaviours.

** Some of the themes of Neil Postman's book Technopoly. **

"Technopoly" is a book by Neil Postman that explores the cultural and social consequences of the proliferation of technology. Some of the themes of the book include:

The dangers of a society that is overly reliant on technology: Postman argues that a society that is overly reliant on technology can lose touch with its history, culture, and values, and can become vulnerable to manipulation and control by technological elites.

The role of technology in shaping society and culture: Postman contends that technology has a powerful influence on the way we think, communicate, and interact with each other, and that it can shape our values, beliefs, and worldviews in profound ways.

The need for critical thinking and skepticism towards technology: Postman encourages readers to be mindful of the ways in which technology can shape our perceptions and understanding of the world, and to adopt a critical and skeptical attitude towards it.

The importance of preserving humanistic values in a technological society: Postman argues that it is important to preserve and promote humanistic values such as empathy, compassion, and wisdom in a technological society, and to resist the temptation to rely solely on technological solutions to social and cultural problems.

** The philosophy of David Deutsch... **

David Deutsch is a British physicist and philosopher who is known for his contributions to the field of quantum mechanics and his ideas about the nature of reality and knowledge.

Deutsch is a proponent of the idea that reality is fundamentally indeterminate and that knowledge is the result of the interaction between an observer and the world.

He has also argued that there is no fundamental limit to the extent of human knowledge, and that we can continue to learn and make progress indefinitely.

In his book "The Beginning of Infinity," Deutsch discusses his views on the nature of reality and knowledge, and the importance of openness and creativity in driving scientific and technological progress.

He also explores the potential of humanity to overcome its limitations and to shape its own future through the use of science and technology.

Deutsch's ideas have been influential in the fields of physics, philosophy, and technology, and he is known for his unconventional and forward-thinking perspective.


** David Pearce's work... **

David Pearce is a British philosopher who is known for his work on the ethics of animal welfare and the elimination of suffering.

Pearce is a proponent of the idea that it is possible and desirable to create a world without suffering, and that we have a moral obligation to strive towards this goal.

He has argued that advances in science and technology, including the development of artificial intelligence, can be used to create a utopia in which all sentient beings are free from suffering.

In his book "The Hedonistic Imperative," Pearce outlines his vision for a world in which suffering has been eliminated through the use of biotechnology and the creation of a "post-human" society.

He argues that the elimination of suffering is a moral imperative and that we have a responsibility to use our knowledge and technology to achieve this goal.

Pearce's ideas have been controversial and have generated much debate in the fields of philosophy, ethics, and animal welfare.


** Some examples of multiscale models. **

Multiscale models are mathematical models that describe systems that operate at multiple different scales or levels of resolution. Some examples of systems that can be modeled using multiscale techniques include:

Materials: Multiscale models can be used to predict the properties and behavior of materials, such as the strength and conductivity of metals, the elasticity and fracture toughness of ceramics, and the viscosity and surface tension of fluids.

Biological systems: Multiscale models can be used to understand the behavior of biological systems, such as the dynamics of gene regulation, the mechanisms of protein folding, and the functioning of the immune system.

Environmental systems: Multiscale models can be used to study environmental systems, such as the water cycle, the carbon cycle, and the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and the Earth's climate.

Social and economic systems: Multiscale models can be used to analyze social and economic systems, such as the spread of diseases, the dynamics of financial markets, and the impacts of social networks on human behavior.


** Explain the difficulty of determining boundary layers. **

Determining boundary layers, or the thin regions of fluid that exist near solid boundaries, can be challenging for several reasons.

One reason is that boundary layers are often very thin, and can be difficult to measure or resolve accurately using experimental or computational techniques.

This can make it difficult to obtain accurate data on the properties and behavior of boundary layers, and can limit the precision and reliability of models that seek to describe them.

Another reason that determining boundary layers can be difficult is that they are often affected by a variety of factors, such as the shape and roughness of the solid boundary, the properties of the fluid, and the presence of external forces or flows.

These factors can interact in complex ways and can make it difficult to predict the behavior of boundary layers accurately.

Finally, boundary layers can be affected by a variety of physical phenomena, such as turbulence, viscous forces, and heat and mass transfer, which can further complicate their behavior and make it difficult to model them accurately.

Overall, the combination of these factors can make it challenging to determine boundary layers and to develop accurate and reliable models of their behavior.
