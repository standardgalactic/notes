summarize: When Schopenhauer was asked where he wished to be buried, he answered, "Anywhere; they will find me;" and the stone that marks his grave at Frankfort bears merely the inscription "Arthur Schopenhauer," without even the date of his birth or death. Schopenhauer, the pessimist, had a sufficiently optimistic conviction that his message to the world would ultimately be listened to--a conviction that never failed him during a lifetime of disappointments, of neglect in quarters where perhaps he would have most cherished appreciation; a conviction that only showed some signs of being justified a few years before his death. Schopenhauer was no opportunist; he was not even conciliatory; he never hesitated to declare his own faith in himself, in his principles, in his philosophy; he did not ask to be listened to as a matter of courtesy but as a right--a right for which he would struggle, for which he fought, and which has

Here is a summary of the text:

The text is about the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer and his confident belief that his philosophy would be recognized by the world. He was a pessimist who faced many rejections and ignored in his life, but he never gave up on his ideas. He did not care about where he would be buried or how he would be remembered, only that his message would be heard. He claimed his right to be listened to as a matter of justice, not politeness.

more succinctly than that: Although everything that Schopenhauer wrote was written more or less as evidence to support his main philosophical thesis, his unifying philosophical principle, the essays in this volume have an interest, if not altogether apart, at least of a sufficiently independent interest to enable them to be considered on their own merits, without relation to his main idea. And in dissociating them, if one may do so for a moment (their author would have scarcely permitted it!), one feels that one enters a field of criticism in which opinions can scarcely vary. So far as his philosophy is concerned, this unanimity does not exist; he is one of the best abused amongst philosophers; he has many times been explained and condemned exhaustively, and no doubt this will be as many times repeated. What the trend of his underlying philosophical principal was, his metaphysical explanation of the world, is indicated in almost all the following essays, but chiefly in the "Metaphysics of Love," to which the reader may be referred.

Here is a more succinct summary of the text:

The text is about the essays of Schopenhauer that are not directly related to his main philosophical idea, which is controversial and often criticized. The text suggests that these essays can be appreciated for their own merits and insights, without considering his metaphysical views. The text also gives an example of one essay that illustrates his philosophy.
