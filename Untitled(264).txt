The theory of compressor of compressors, as formulated by Wojciech Zaremba and Jurgen Schmidhuber, posits that the ability to compress data and information in novel ways is a key aspect of intelligence and creativity. This idea is also related to the mathematical representation of tree-level amplitudes in physics, which has been shown to be incredibly compact and more transparent due to the discovery of new symmetries. These symmetries have been related to the volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of the nonnegative Grassmannian.
