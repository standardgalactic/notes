Certainly! Below is a glossary of Pipsqueak terms used in the conversation with standard English equivalents:

- **"bit small not known yet"**: Quantum Vacuum Uncertainty
- **"start when ready"**: Initiating the race when participants are prepared, not at a universal signal
- **"not all once"**: Not starting simultaneously
- **"unsure race start"**: Unpredictable initiation of a race
- **"Null-Convention-Logic in talk"**: Communication style where speakers interject without waiting for their turn, similar to Null Convention Logic (NCL)
- **"speak, no wait, when wish"**: Speaking when desired without waiting for a turn
- **"Pipsqueak like whisper"**: The Pipsqueak language being similar to whispering
- **"make beatbox with word"**: Using the Pipsqueak language for beatboxing
- **"all tie, all flow"**: All ideas are interconnected and flow together
- **"word use in talk for person, place"**: Deixis in linguistics, focusing on person and spatial deixis
- **"big think use feel of space and body feel"**: Human cognition and abstract thinking relying on spatial processing and embodied experiences
- **"Endokinematics"**: Continuous, subtle movements and adjustments within the human body
- **"like wave move"**: Fourier Analysis and wave motion in relation to human movement
- **"have order in body for walk, move"**: Hierarchical organization of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) that control locomotion
- **"like analysis of wave"**: Analyzing Endokinematics in a way akin to Fourier-like analysis of wave motions
- **"how save and get back memory"**: Semantic memoryâ€™s role in cognitive abilities, imagination, and memory retrieval
- **"how save, call back memory"**: Concepts like synergistic ecphory and recall relating to sensory modalities during memory encoding and retrieval

Remember, Pipsqueak is not a formally recognized language, so these are interpretative translations based on the playful language style used in our conversation.

Thank you. A final summary of the conversation, in Pipsqueak, using as many of the terms as you can.

Start talk on race: start when ready, not all once. Think "bit small not known yet", like unsure race start. Null-Convention-Logic in talk: speak, no wait, when wish. Pipsqueak like whisper, can make beatbox with word. Then, word use in talk for person, place. Big think use feel of space, body feel for not see stuff. Talk of "Endokinematics", like wave move, have order in body for walk, move. Talk also of how save, get back memory, with feel and see help. All tie, all flow in talk.

An English translation

We started the conversation discussing races, where participants start when ready, not all at once. We contemplated the "Quantum Vacuum Uncertainty", likening it to the unpredictable initiation of races. We mentioned communication using Null-Convention-Logic, where individuals speak when they wish without waiting.

The Pipsqueak language, similar to whispering, can be used creatively for beatboxing. We then discussed deixis in linguistics, particularly focusing on person and spatial deixis, and explored abstract thinking that relies on spatial processing and embodied experiences.

We introduced "Endokinematics", describing continuous subtle movements within the body, similar to wave movements, with a hierarchical organization in the body for walking and other movements. We also talked about memory storage and retrieval, and how sensory modalities assist in these processes. All these ideas are interconnected and flowed seamlessly throughout our conversation.
