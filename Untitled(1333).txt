Great! You're off to a good start. In Python, you can calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem just as you would in Bash, but Python has built-in support for floating-point arithmetic and more advanced mathematical functions through the `math` module. 

Here's how you can complete your Python command to calculate the hypotenuse:

```python
import math

a = 2.0
b = 3.0
hypotenuse = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
print("The length of the hypotenuse is:", hypotenuse)
```

In this code:
- `math.sqrt()` is used to calculate the square root.
- `a**2 + b**2` calculates the sum of the squares of sides `a` and `b`.
- Finally, it prints out the length of the hypotenuse. 

You can execute this in your Python interactive shell. If you want to make it interactive so that it prompts the user for the values of `a` and `b`, you could modify it like this:

```python
import math

a = float(input("Enter the length of side a: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of side b: "))
hypotenuse = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
print("The length of the hypotenuse is:", hypotenuse)
```

This way, it will ask the user to input the lengths of the sides.
