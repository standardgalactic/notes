Children's author Victoria Winifred picked up on the story begun in William Jones's poem in her 2022 mythological fantasy, "The Princess, the Knight, and the Lost God: A Chess Story". In this continuation, Mars and Caïssa were wed after the events told in Jones's rendition. Caïssa then received her immortality and goddesship from Mars, and they reigned together over the kingdom of Chess Mountain. Later, their 12-year-old daughter, Princess Kassie, goes on to establish her own goddess title in the chess realm through a series of adventures and a mission completed on Earth.  

Caïssa is referred to in chess commentary.

Garry Kasparov uses this reference now and again, especially in his five-volume work My Great Predecessors. He cites her as a metaphor for good luck – "Caïssa was with me" – especially in unclear situations, for example in sacrifices.[5]

The 1994 book The March of Chess Ideas by Anthony Saidy extensively uses Caïssa as well.

T. R. Dawson extensively used Caïssa, both as a character to provide literary narrative to accompany his problem collections,[6] and merely as a convenient personification of chess.[7]

The chess variant Caïssa Britannia, created by Fergus Duniho, was named after Caïssa.

When writing about chess, Heinrich Fraenkel used the pseudonym "Assiac", which is "Caïssa" spelled backwards.

Antonio Radić, a Croatian YouTuber who runs the channel 'agadmator's Chess Channel', has created a chess-based manga named "Age of Caissa", depicting a post-apocalyptic world ruled by artificial intelligence.

Caïssa as a concept has also been explored by some who seek the evidence of the sacred feminine in chess.[citation needed]

The computer program that won the first World Computer Chess Championship (in 1974) was named Kaissa.

The card game Android: Netrunner features a program type named Caïssa, which are modeled after chess pieces.
