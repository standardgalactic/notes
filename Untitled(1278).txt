imagine you are fifteen years old taking your little sister to
the grocery store because your dad is busy and your
grandmother is old and you need food. as you turn a corner
you accidentally ram your shopping cart into God with a
capital G and he promises to show you the world you've
never seen from inside the ten square miles of your
hometown in exchange for your company. you hate the risk
but your demigod sister has untapped potential and an
unrelenting determination to get ghost, so you follow God
with a capital G through heaven and hell and back. God with
a capital G is twelve but also somehow over a hundred but
also sometimes unspeakably ancient and eldritch. he is
wiser than your grandmother and treats everything like a
game and interferes with the fate of whole villages like he's
picking flowers to make a flower crown. you spend half your
ime trying to dodge the emperor's autistic son whose
special interest is kidnapping God (because the emperor is
scared that God will interfere with the various genocides he
has planned) but God is your little brother now and you
would (and have and will) kill and die for him. your first love
becomes a different god and you add her name to the list of
things (your childhood, your vulnerability, your parents, your
safety) that you don't have the time to grieve right now (or
ever) and you become a man on bloodsoaked battlefields a
thousand miles from home and your dad isn't there to see it.
you are fifteen and God with a capital G's best friend and
your little sister-sisters, now, you picked up another one-
are the most powerful demigods on the planet and you are
the only one keeping three divine tweens focused on saving
the world while God keeps trying to do sidequests involving
riding extremely lethal hellbeasts and you are stil not
allowed to say f_ck.
