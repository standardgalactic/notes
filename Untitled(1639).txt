Of all the people who could tell you to stop using your own mobile device, inevitably it will always end up for that person to be a vertical screen user. 

After they have been allowed for a life time to not know how to use their own f*cking screen they moved one step up, and now, in their delusion, they think that us using a mobile device is something to be condemned 

Of course if you are that f*cking dumb to look at vertical screen you tend to end up and also see how useless a screen oriented that way, is, but instead of blaming the error of your ways you start thinking that other people are a problem because they use a mobile device
