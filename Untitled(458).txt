Your post about your childhood was a little triggering.

Maybe I have a better memory of what happened then you did, I really tried not to get involved, but I couldn't get it out of my head how much fighting and yelling went on in your house in the early days, I seem to remember a time when you guys wished your father dead, and for a long time he said some horrible things about me and tried to destroy my reputation.

Maybe it seemed normal to you to want to run away from home as a young child, but I hadn't experienced that.

I had a degree in psychology and linguistics (2005) before I met you guys, and so it was obvious to me that you had a bad speech impediment and couldn't read. I could go into greater detail very easily.
