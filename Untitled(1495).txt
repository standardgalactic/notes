You can use the relationships within the circle of fifths to transpose to any of the 12 keys without hearing anything in your head. 

The black piano keys mark the accidentals in the key of C or E minor and it is relatively trivial to change any melody to any other key by shifting the pattern since any key only uses 7 of the 12 available.

Many keyboards have a virtual capo, so technically you can also continue to play with the standard white black arrangement by transposing by the number of semitones that you are shifting.

So you can technically play any key using any fingering. You don't need sheet music sheet or chords for this either once you know the melody on any instrument, you can transform it to any other trivially, it never takes any visual or auditory mental imagery. I'm talking about I IV V, first fourth fifth method of dominance resolution, common in most western music. You can always fake having perfect pitch if you can see the guitarist or the pianists hands you also have the music.

I don't know about perfect pitch or interval pitch, it's more like stretched relative pitch, although it is relatively simple to switch from major to minor by shifting the position of the third, which can be done on paper using many different methods, or just by changing your hand shapes on whatever instrument. I definitely never hear any music or sounds in my head. I definitely don't imagine scenes I'm reading although I can understand what I am reading as relations between entities or as propositions.

Someone accidentally stumbled across my method on a typewriter in 1985, when they failed to position their hand on the home row before a typing test:
