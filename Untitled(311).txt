I'm sorry, but I don't have any information on the secular religions "Mckolaleehanehourtoholl," "Benelerarweiaunslp," or "Pebenoupelnili."

It's possible that these are fictional or recently created religious movements that are not widely recognized.

Can you provide more context or information about these religions so I can better understand what you're looking for?

I'm sorry, but I don't have any information on the secular religions "Mckolaleehanehourtoholl," "Benelerarweiaunslp," or "Pebenoupelnili."

These seem to be fictional or recently created religious movements that are not widely recognized.

It is not possible to provide a detailed explanation of these movements as they likely do not have well-established beliefs, practices, or followings.

Sendashe is a non-theistic belief system that emphasizes living a lifestyle of peace and joy. It is described as not involving worship of any gods, but instead focuses on promoting peace, harmony, and well-being in daily life.

The tenets of Sendashe may include practices or principles such as mindfulness, compassion, and ethical behavior, as well as an emphasis on personal growth and self-discovery.

It is likely that the beliefs and practices of Sendashe may vary among those who identify with the faith, as non-theistic belief systems often lack a centralized authority or set of doctrines.

As an atheistic faith, Gendicca likely does not involve worship of gods or belief in the supernatural.

The origins of Gendicca are not specified. As a secular, non-theistic faith, it may have evolved from a variety of sources or have been created by a specific individual or group of individuals.

It is possible that the beliefs and practices of Gendicca have been influenced by other non-theistic belief systems, such as humanism, secular spirituality, or mindfulness-based practices.

However, without further information, it is difficult to determine the specific origins of Gendicca.

Gendicca, as described, seems to have been influenced by the beliefs and practices of Cyclofabianism, Holistic Anocracy, and Motile Womb Theory. Cyclofabianism is likely a made-up term, but if it exists, it may have contributed to Gendicca's holistic view of life.

Holistic Anocracy emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of understanding the self, which may have informed Gendicca's focus on self-reflection and personal development.

Finally, Motile Womb Theory is likely a fictional theory, but if it exists, it may have influenced Gendicca's focus on the importance of understanding the self and the connection between all things.

Gendicca, as you mentioned, was influenced by Cyclofabianism, Holistic Anocracy, and Motile Womb Theory, which are diverse and complex philosophical and theoretical movements.

Cyclofabianism's roots can be traced back to the Fabian Society and Zera Yacob, while Motile Womb Theory incorporates theories of the mind and Global Workspace theory to explore the origins of human cognition and decision making.

This information provides a broader context for Gendicca, but the specific beliefs and practices of the faith are unknown to me as they are not a well-known or widely recognized secular religion.

Gendicca is an atheistic faith based on a holistic view of life and the importance of understanding the self. Its origins are influenced by Cyclofabianism, Holistic Anocracy, and Motile Womb Theory.

Cyclofabianism is based on the Fabian society and its strategy, drawing from the philosophy of Zera Yacob and others.

Motile Womb Theory posits that humans learn about inertia and agency in the womb and that they are born with Innate Flying Dreams.

This theory is based on Global Workspace theory and a theory of mind called Reed Wall Mind, which uses Noah's as a metaphor for human cognition, seeing Noah as a holistic decision maker or attention mechanism in a modular, multiscale, and heterarchical model of the mind.

Gendicca likely incorporates elements of these influences to form a holistic understanding of the self and life, valuing self-reflection and personal development.

However, as the information provided is limited, a more detailed explanation of the exact tenets and beliefs of Gendicca is not possible.
