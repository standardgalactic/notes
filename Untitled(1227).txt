One of my interesting open-source work
projects is building out a zk-SaaS network
In short, prove to me f(x) = y without telling
me x, as a service. The applications for
this are endless. Zero Knowledge is the
future of zero-trust.

Joe Mauriello depends on the
method. In general, you map
the statement you're trying to
prove into polynomials then
take advantage of the
mathematical properties of
those polynomials to work the
mathemagic.

So, you could do a zero
knowledge password proof by
doing a hash preimage proof
of the argon2 password hash
function.
