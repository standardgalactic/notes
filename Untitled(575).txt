1. AGI is happening soon. .
Significant probability of it
happening in less than 5 years.
Five years ago, there were many obstacles on what

Powerful Agents (Agent57, GATO, Dreamer
V3)
Reliably good Multimodal Models
(StableDiffusion, Whisper, Clip)
Just about every language tasks
(GPT3, ChatGPT, Bing Chat)
Human and Social Manipulation
Robots (Boston Dynamics)
AIs that are superhuman at just about any
task we can (or simply bother to) define a
benchmark for
We don't have any obstacle left in mind that we
don't expect to get overcome in more than 6
months after efforts are invested to take it down.
