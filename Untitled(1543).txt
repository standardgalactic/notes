Coordinate Space in Math

Building up spacetime with quantum entanglement (Reference to Mark Van Raamsdonk's work)

A mathematical theory of semantic development in deep neural networks (Reference to the work of Andrew M. Saxe, James L. McClelland, and Surya Ganguli)

Human cognition and the nature of semantic knowledge

Empirical observations in semantic knowledge acquisition

Neuroscientific insights into semantic knowledge

Existing gaps and challenges in understanding semantic development in neural circuits

These topics primarily revolve around advanced concepts in quantum physics and cognitive neuroscience, specifically how deep neural networks understand and process semantic information.
