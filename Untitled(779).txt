Pleased to announce version Beta 27 of the collaborative OPEN-SOURCE project LIFE123.SCIENCE , featuring improvements in adaptive time steps in solving tangles of chemical reactions, and newly-added support for Enzymes.

There are times to crawl... and times to run!

Can't waste computation when little is changing...

As a PLATFORM for SYSTEMS BIOLOGY, https://life123.science offers a growing set of tools to wrestle the complications of numerical solutions to complex dynamical systems, such as cycles of biochemical reactions and diffusion.

* ONLY 1/2 OF THE BATTLE, is to offer functionality to set up and simulate webs of reactions, optionally with spatial components and diffusion (plus - upcoming - membranes and macromolecules...)

* The OTHER 1/2 OF THE BATTLE is a battery of tools, to tame numerical instabilities, to throttle up/down the computational effort, to visualize & analyze the results, to provide helpful diagnostics, and to integrate high-performance computing: a collaboration among software engineering, data science, numerical methods, biochemistry & biology, among other fields.

Explore it all with just a few lines of Python code in convenient Jupyter notebooks! (optionally in a 1-click hosted environment ðŸ˜Š  )
