A kind of explanation of the details of the HSSR algorithm.

The HSSR algorithm, or High Resolution Gender System, is a system for classifying and identifying individual genders based on a combination of several factors.

Geozotal Gender: This is determined by averaging the physical features of individuals living in or occupying a specific region of the world, which is divided into 26 zones based on the letters of the Latin alphabet. This gender classification is updated on a yearly or quarterly basis.

MBTI Gender: This is determined by using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality test to classify individuals into different personality types. This gender classification is also updated on a yearly or quarterly basis.

Human Male and Female: These are averages of the physical features of the human male and female population, determined by random sampling with no reference to region.

Hyperhuman Gender: This is determined by identifying which cartoon character or mechsuit an individual most resembles.

The HSSR algorithm allows for trillions of possible genders, as it takes into 
account a wide range of parameters such as location, physical appearance, personality, and platonic solid resemblance, and updates the classifications on a regular basis. This system is intended to provide a unique, individualized gender prompt for each person, at each point in time.
