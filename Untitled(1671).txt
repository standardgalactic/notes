To Be a Machine and In Our Own Image are two of my absolute favourite books that take on the deeply beloved topic of human vs the machine, and it’s been a long time since I’ve read something on their level. Now, I can add The Creativity Code to that list. For Marcus Du Sautoy, creativity is not this abstract romanticised concept but instead “creativity is about humans asserting they are not machines”. This alone should give you a snippet to the overarching tone of this book. (less)

Read this in preparation for an interview with Marcus (side note: the BBC series he hosted - ‘Story of Maths’ - was partly the inspiration for me studying maths at uni, so I was pretty excited to get to chat with him on stage..!)

I enjoyed this book. It’s about AI and creativity, and yes it does the kind of standard AI art stuff - ‘will AI replace artists etc etc’ - but once you get past that (fair play if you like that stuff; imo it’s extremely overdone), there’s some wonderful ideas in here about mathematical creativity and ‘why we even do pure maths’, which is 100% worth the read.

I feel like I spend a lot of time convincing people that doing pure maths is like doing art - it’s about the thought process and the pursuit of proof and the indescribable ‘a-ha’ moments when something just clicks. And this book, paired with Hardy’s ‘A Mathematician’s Apology’, does a superb job of not only bringing this to life, but questioning what it’s really about and what the future of it might look like in a world seemingly obsessed with automating even the most pure forms of human delight.

Read Hardy, then read this.

(Oh and you can watch back my interview with Marcus on some of these big topics - just Google CogX 2020 and our names and it’ll come up 😇) (less)

Maybe because I am familiar with deep learning, i found this book the worst kind of insufferable dry musing with no apparent destination. You get a retelling of the AlphaGo game like it was a political drama, pages and pages about how the author counted tiles at the Serpentine, yet no actual depth to any of the algorithms beyond 'it adjusts based on my new input' or 'has a random seed'. No rigourous philosophical comparison of underlying approaches beyond the 'Lovelace test' - something that is more for publicity than actual relevance imho. Neither is there any actual social commentary beyond 'Cambridge Analytica bad! Spotify mediocre!'

It is just such a bizarre collage of shallow info on disjointed topics that never makes a bigger picture that I wonder who the audience is. (less)

It's pretty hard to read about topics like AI that are at the vanguard of technology. I think I finished this book abt 2 months ago and in that time there's already been an explosion in commercial AI art usage (Dall-E, Midjourney, NovelAI, Stable Diffusion etc..) that has wiped the floor with many ideas explored here. AI creation is developing at such a breakneck pace that new programs are kicking out any novelty by the time a book has been written. I feel like twitter is a better place to look at new stuff

Regardless, the book such a slog to read. The author gives anecdotes such as the AlphaGo game with this sterile ass prose presenting everyday people as a monolith fighting against progress. Interpretation is rendered binary; so much about composition is seen through a procedural lens of algorithms + huge sample sizes = out comes product.
+ A lot of surface level technical stuff about AI deep learning that taps into a v large database with a lot of computation..

I'm disappointed because I was clickbaited by the title. I feel like the advent of AI is this insanely gripping topic in an apocalyptic existential crisis about becoming obsolete sort of way (like what is the role of the artist, what use do they serve?). This is more of a dry mathematical catalogue of anecdotes.

Very interesting read! The author picks up many intriguing examples of algorithms that can beat human Go masters, create new Rembrandt paintings, compose music, write poetry and much more, all the while explaining how it works, without going too far into the technical details and explaining in a fashion easy to follow for someone who is not acquainted with the subject. But is this art? The book doesn't give a "yes or no" answer, but rather many thought-provoking ideas and thoughts about this matter, spanning across various fields of science from mathematics and computer science to neuroscience, linguistics and more. (less)

Who's this for:

In the end this book, or better its main question, is more philosophical than technical or creative. It's more about what we deem to be creative. So I guess the book is best suited for people that have some background on the technical part and want to broaden their horizons, adding some meat to the philosophical bone.

If you are a creative (and assume that machines can't be creative) and want to understand more about the technical part to open your thinking, the book probably doesn't deliver convincing enough its points. Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies delivers a more robust fundament for that and should be read first.

I liked:

- The combination of mathematics and creativity. Gives a widening of horizon for both angles.

- That the author gave a good overview and enough, but not too much or detailed, history about AI, it's earliest developments, important happenings and more or less a current state.

- That I got some additional insights and appreciation of art, music, and in particular classical music, which has surprisingly much to do with mathematics. On the other hand it's not that surprising either.

- I really liked that the author actually did some experiments and tests himself and had a good hands-on approach. It shows that he actually got deep into the topic.

- That you can learn besides how computer work and think also a bit how humans work and think. That we developed the system of Generative Adversarial Network to judge the vast possible options of possible generations (of an image, idea or else) sounds remarkably similar to how we come up with ideas, find them ingenious and after a night of sleep we judge it ourselves as maybe not such a good idea.

I didn't like:

- It's a bit basic on the technical side if you familiar with certain terms in AI, neuronal networks, machine learning, etc. Some examples are even more confusing to get. A layman might get a too different understanding because it's a tad too dumbed down. Not sure how to do that better though without repel the broader audience.

- While I liked the basic introduction of the topics, it missed a bit to develop really the core insight he wanted to deliver. Or at least I expected a bit more a "scientific approach" to answering the question and not just explanatory history.

- Only on the very last pages he takes a stance that he believes that computers can get conscious and with that become "creative" (whatever that means in the end). I wished a bit more of a combination of logical reasoning and philosophical discussion why and how that could be (but maybe Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies is a better read for this). The book is mostly of the form: "Computers cannot do X because it can't think creative. Followed by an example and a group that successfully developed an algorithm or system that did X." This will go on and on until we get to a strong AI and then all of those questions get irrelevant. While this seems obvious for someone that has spent a bit time thinking about this topic (or has read Superintelligence) for a reader that hasn't arrived there already, it's not that obvious to grasp that point (from the last couple pages).

- I loved the comparison for the proof about the infinity of prime numbers from the Mizar system with the "prose proof" he gave. But this is an unfair comparison as the prose is not rigorous enough to be a proof. It certainly helps to understand how it works and is enough to follow a proof but it's not sufficient. Again as a layman you easily could get fooled by believing this was enough.


Things I learned:

- About classical music and how it's composed and that it had more to do with understanding the mathematical and structural side of music than "knowing what good music is and what not". Humans love patterns and structures so we prefer it also in music. Bach definitely understood that not only intuitively. The author also hints at current pop music and it's based on a proven model music-wise (and that's why it's boring from that perspective). At this point I'd like to link to The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory which goes into the details how that happened and how modern, at least pop-, music works.

- Babylonians started to calculate with symbols to abstract away some tediousness. They observed more and came up with certain rules and structures how numbers behaved. They invented the basics of Algebra. They didn't proof it though.

- The Greeks later stared to proof those observed behaviours. This based in their general development of rhetorics and logic. They wanted to to have a logical model to proof to other about a certain fact based on arguments and not only convincing.

- The book also shows again our collective chauvinism how we think we are, as a species, so special because we are "creative" and a machine can't be. As the author delivers towards the end, it's just a question of time that we can develop a machine that can also be better at "creative" on any scale we want to measure it. It's probably also better at defining what that is at all.

This is a brilliantly written, interesting book about AI and its implications on the realm of creativity. This is the first book I've read by Marcus du Sautoy and after reading this book, I'm going to read his other books. His ability to explain complex mathematical and AI concepts in a way I could understand is phenomenal. The concepts that most resonated with me are his explanations and stories surrounding the three types of creativity (Exploratory, Combinational, and Transformative) and how AI and humans use them. (less)

A great book when it comes to outlining the status quo and advances of AI in creative areas such as playing Go, composing music, writing novels or proving mathematical theorems. The author is leading us on a journey through the extensive AI projects such as AlphaGo or DeepBach whose results leave people speechless and also lead to the question if algorithms will develop a form of consciousness one day.

It is definitely a very refreshing book that will keep you engaged but it fails to capture the essence of AI/neural networks; how they work and evolve. The author merely scratches the surface and stops elaborating further when it starts to become really interesting. But anything else would probably go beyond the scope of this book, as its intention is to provide an overview of the world of AI rather than giving a detailed and complex explanation of how it reaches its "creative" output. (less)

This book was written by someone who loves math much more than I love most things. It’s hard to relate in some places to how he explains math as art, as I profoundly dislike writing proofs, and mostly just see equations for their purpose and not much more. I do see the art in building algorithms from a programming sense though, as I DO enjoy chasing efficiency, robustness, and the like. All this aside, the author has an incredible knack for story telling. To make some of these concepts that could be seen as dry into stories with emotion and intrigue is truly a skill I do not possess but wish I did. I groaned when I realized much of the book was going to be about AI beating Chess and AI beating Go… AGAIN.. but it was done in a refreshing way that had me captivated! Well done! (less)

Du Sautoy’s The Creativity Code is framed by a claim by Ada Lovelace, the nineteenth-century computing theorist, that a chief limit of “the Analytical Machine” (or computer) is it “has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform” (p. 2). In short, Du Sautoy wants to know if recent advances in AI such as neural networks have done anything to challenge Lovelace’s claim. As the title suggests, the focus of his examination is on creativity, especially a truly “transformational” or “phase change” form of creativity: he cites Picasso, Goethe, and the square root of minus one as examples (pp. 9-10). In the chapters that follow he leads with an account of Deep Mind’s victory over human champions in the game of Go (weiqi) and then explains the algorithms behind the program and how they apply to the successive fields of visual art, math, music, and literature.

With modest prior background on theories of creativity and innovation and in recent developments in AI, I found it was not until somewhere between chapter 5 (p. 61) and chapter 6 (p. 75) when he started getting deep into advanced algorithms that I actually started learning much. I do not think I am actually an outlier on this point: rather, the author has an unfortunate tendency in the first few chapters toward an excessively conversational—even chatty—style that leans too much toward accessibility at the expense of depth. The most obvious example is in Du Sautoy’s definition of creativity, for which he provides only a single framework, that of Margret Boden. And despite leaning exclusively on Boden’s typologies for a book-length study on creativity, he provides exactly two sentences about her background: one of which focuses on her age (past 80), appearance (“white hair flying like sparks”), and quirky pet name for computers as “tin cans” (p. 7). Surely as a scholar he has thought more seriously about this and compared different approaches. One does not have to look far for better writing on the subject. In Creating Innovators (2012), for example, national bestseller Tony Wagner cites at least 20 different voices as he works toward a definition of “innovation.”

Despite the uneven start, I did find the bulk of the later discussion to be quite good. Du Sautoy is well positioned to tell the story as a scholar of pure mathematics and a gentle skeptic of the more enthusiastic claims made on the part of AI. Even in the early account of Go, for example, it was illuminating that Alpha Go showed that even hundreds of years of competitive human ingenuity was subject to the algorithmic trap of “local maximums”; by lifting the fog of convention, the AI was able to imagine new possibilities for playing the game. These kinds of insights came more frequently in the latter chapters. I was interested to learn that artistic originality can be charted algorithmically (called the “Wandt curve,” p. 131) and that some speculate that theoretical mathematics may be rapidly approaching the end of what humans are capable of doing without the aid of AI. De Sautoy is arguably at his best in discussing mathematics and music. It turns out that math is far more important to the way our brains separate “good” from “bad” sounding music than most of us would be comfortable admitting. For this reason, AI has progressed quickly toward providing tunes serviceable as unique—if somewhat banal—backdrops to TikTok clips and video games. Math and music (and perhaps literature) were also the areas where Du Sautoy delved into the greatest philosophical depth. I quite enjoyed the argument that music itself contains no intrinsic emotionality, and even work that seems as naturally emotive as Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata” still requires of the listener all the work of actually constructing an emotional response. Given the same claim could be made for language or even physical intimacy, I would suggest the claim needs to be more carefully bounded to hold up to scrutiny, though I appreciate the way the position creates an opening for the role of AI as creative producer.

As to whether AI has indeed surpassed the Lovelace test, a Du Sautoy reader might reasonably come away believing that the potential exists and has, under certain conditions and under constraints, already been realized. What the future holds for AI is uncertain, of course, though Du Sautoy shows us how important the question of creativity is not just for measuring advances in computation but also for how we live and the ways we think about our shared existence. (less)

Yet she [Ada Lovelace] believed that any act of creativity would lie with the coder, not the machine. Is it possible to shift the wight of responsibility more towards the code? The current generation of coders believes it is.

TL;DR: We're not there yet. But we're not too far away.

Mind you, this book was published in 2019. Leaps and bounds in the field of AI does not happen by years, they happen by months. Since the publication of the Creativity Code, AI has learned how to:
• Understand jokes
• How to generate an image from a mere abstract suggestion
• Feel pain

There have been seminal moments in the novel but eventful history of AI, even in the last decade that was covered in the book. For du Sautoy, the most pivotal moment in AI was the day when DeepMind managed to beat Go's world champion, Lee Sedol. In all honesty, I know much about a game of Go as I do about DOTA - It's there, I watch the contest more than the game itself, but not something that I would likely learn in the future. Go is far more complex than chess and though chess GrandMasters now struggle to beat chessbots, Go masters were still able to beat the computer in Go without as much as breaking a sweat.


I watched the doco on this game and to this day is still my favourite documentary that I visit now and then in YouTube. Lee Sedol, humiliated by a cold hard machine, looking at the friendly face of AJ Wang, who moves the pieces as AlphaGo would if he had a mechanical hand (thankfully we weren't there yet) was ambushed by AlphaGo's fluid creativity. I feel for the guy because Go is as big as Gordon Ramsay is in Hell's Kitchen in South Korea, and the flashes just exacerbated his humiliation in the post-match interview.

To mathematicians, Lee Sedol's defeat is a sobering moment. For them, mathematics is still something untouched, a discipline which requires a mixture of human creativity, genius and balls of steel in order to solve proofs and equations which in turn, will progress human thought. For once, Du Sautoy felt that his job was in danger. This existential crisis drove him to write the book, to thoroughly research where AI stands as a discipline and to get in touch with AlphaGo's head honcho, Demis Hassabis who back in the day, was also a chess prodigy.

De Sautoy's approach is to log the progress of AI in the fields where human creativity is most prominent: in art. AI can now generate music based on Bach's composition to the point of fooling experts that its creation is better than the original. AI can also can paint as it has been instructed to do, but following the mood of the day. The "Painting Fool" is able to create a painting which is depressing in tone if the news headlines at the epoch is also doom and gloom. AI can also write and generate stories which read better than Twilight or the majority of English majors.

If this worries you, it shouldn't. Yet. In every single one of these projects, there is too much of the shade of the creator for the AI to be considered fully independent. Perhaps this statement is apt:

Art is ultimately the expression of human free will, and until the computers have their own version of this, art generated by a computer will always be traceable back to a human desire to create.

What we think of machine intelligence, really is our own desire to push our creative boundaries warped by the interpretation of algorithms.

What I appreciate about The Creativity Code is the readability despite the natural complexity of the subject. Du Sautoy briefly touched on the evolution of machine learning and how an algorithm is trained like an athelete in the Soviet Union. When he does, I needed to read the pages a few times, but you're never lost and it is worth focusing on these because some of the methods use to train algos are fundamental and seemingly so simple. Some of these algos are now used to match medical students to their residencies.

As a novice in the discipline, The Creativity Code is a good introduction of where we are in 2019. I fear that these types of books, as plenty of political science books, will quickly become obsolete as father time vindictively tries to prove naysayers wrong. Du Sautoy's conclusion is more open-ended though. We are some distance away from technological singularity, but the discipline is travelling in lightning speed to close that distance. I'm not sure I'd like to be there when that happens. (less)

3.5. This book examines AI’s forays into the realm of creativity. AI is still used for large-scale computations and data sifting, of course, but we’re seeing more and more instances of programmers trying both top-down and bottom-up approaches to get AI to do things like paint, compose music, and write poetry. This book is pretty anecdotal in its approach, which is something I tend to like. Experts beware: this was written for a layperson. It’s rather surface-level as it takes us through the history of AI, along the way discussing the ways human brain activity resembles algorithms with its pattern-finding expertise and reliance on habit.

The author (du Sautoy) is a mathematician, and in the beginning of the book he made quite the fuss arguing that math is just as creative an endeavor as painting or songwriting. I may have only spent one semester as a math major but I was onboard…until I wasn’t. He pretty much used this baseline as an excuse to go on a joyride through the history of mathematics, to the extent that his tangents about the “narrative drive” of proofs were no longer germane.

My only other grumble would be that I’m already sick of hearing the stories of AI beating human champions in chess, Go, and Jeopardy. But the inclusion of these stories was probably necessary.

The sections about painting, music, and writing were fascinating. Learning about the way AI compiles data and finds patterns to imitate the work of Pollock or Rembrandt was just plain cool. And the stumbling blocks surprised me. Bach’s mathematically-constructed fugues were examined, naturally, and I was delighted to find that the author of Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid also made an appearance in this book as a judge determining whether compositions were generated by humans or AI. The lightest fare was probably centered around AI-generated poetry, screenplays, and chatbot responses. As evidenced by my 5-star rating of You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How Artificial Intelligence Works and Why It's Making the World a Weirder Place, I find that sort of thing just side-splittingly funny.

Du Sautoy keeps the philosophizing fairly light as well. Do these creations have any value, and how much of that value is owed to the humans who write the code? He doesn’t give a clear-cut answer, but he does argue that there are now “meta-algorithms that are encouraged to break the rules and see what happens.” Are these AI teams pushing into territory that might rival human creativity? Probably not yet, but those boundaries blur more with each passing year. (less)

Unexpected joy from a thoughtfully written book
I enjoyed the author's introduction to the philosophy of art in the age of AI. He taught me how to frame the problem and think about creativity itself.

He explains three types of creativity: explorative creativity beyond the edge of familiarity, combinational creativity that merges ideas, and transformational creativity that provides a new perspective, a new paradigm. We want art to be new and surprising, but not too strange. The newness, but familiar enough to resonate, make good quality art.

I initially expected to read how AI could create visual art like Rembrandt style picture. The book was more than that. It covered visual art, music, mathematics, game go, language art. I was surprised mathematics was part of the creative domain. The author, as a mathematician, says that mathematical proof is like storytelling, which requires creativity.

More profoundly, math is inherent in our intelligence to find patterns from nature. Golden ratios or fractals are the mathematical concepts that allow us to create beauty. Naturally, AI is well suited to create such patterns. The author explains teaching AI to create such patterns using certain logic as a top-down approach.

There could be another way to teach AI by introducing art pieces, lots of them, and letting AI learn from them. AI would learn how to create something similar but new. This is a bottom-up approach. We, people, can learn from masterpieces and get intuitions and insights. We are training AI to do the same. There could be some tricky issues. The size of the data may not be enough if we want AI to learn great art only. Human intervention may be needed to tune how much AI would want to push out of the boundary. It can be offputting than pleasantly arousing.

Should we feel an existential threat as an artist, as a mathematician, as a writer, as a musician?
AI-art may not replace our human-made masterpieces but may replace low-budget art needs, say background music of a website that suits its concept. Royalties may get cheaper if AI can produce new music that is ok. We do not need website music to be great. AI could expand the scope of what could be industrialized and automated.

Lastly, would we consider AI as an agent? Is AI an artist? AI art is mainly driven by people and for people (and for money). AI does not create art because it feels depressed or loved. AI creates because it is coded to do so. Having said that, AI might be a smarter and more intelligent tool for creativity, but AI may not be a sentient being "enjoying" what we asked it to create. If that time comes, it will create something we would not understand. (less)

I really liked this! As a museum student, the idea that "art" could be quantified and that things like essence, experience, novelty and value are terms given substance and concrete frameworks, rather than a humanities pseudo-intellectual suggested impressions is more helpful than I could ever even overstate. That human perception is given grounded mathematical basis is refreshing coming from a discipline where all is art is good, is priceless, is impressing, but we must not attempt to ground it as it removes "value" (that again, is unquantified) that could be created by an audience, and we cannot survey the audience for their own opinion because that's not our job feels like a breath of fresh air. Why museum studies and philosophy & psychology are not more tied together I will never know.

The strength of du Sautoy's approaches are when he is working within his realms, so to speak. Things like board games and literature are good in his hands. He lets the idea that the AI is generating content within a framework, not the actual "art" itself, guide his understanding and exposition.
I bristle a bit when he's on the topic of music. Yes music theory has a mathematical structure: but music theory is not music. Du Sautoy's approach that all music is code of sort is on the surface correct, but the idea that the best composers (Note: not musicians. We stick to the realms of Jazz or Classical) are just the best coders. When inspecting ideas, here the author places the importance of music theory over the music itself. He separates musicality as distinct in audience reception of a piece emotionally, yet does not extend the same to composers. Mozart may have been a genius composer, and had an interest in theory and math's implications on it, but that's like saying ee cummings was a grammatician, and not a poet. The historic implications are misplaced. The modern implications are that AI is a tool, and here the implication doesn't even exist.

The section on Rembrandt AI replicants states that the point was not to create a Rembrandt painting, but to see if an AI even could. This argument is the opposite of the ones extended in the music section. Its a very small thing, and he comes back in a way to the modern day stating that in his own experience it isn't the mathematics or theory that inform the music in a meaningful way. So it is a very small critique, and the only gripe I had with this otherwise engaging combination of AI, perceptive psychology, art and creativity, and the human intentionality. (less)

The Creativity Code is a look at artificial intelligence, how it works, and what it might be able to do. Starting with what Ada Lovelace said about computing machines and creativity, Marcus du Sautoy goes through the achievements of AI so far, the mathematics that underpins machine learning, and explores the meaning of 'creativity', in order to look at whether computers will ever be able to be truly 'creative'.

What unfolds is a book that crosses disciplines, touching upon computer science and programming, mathematical proofs and the storytelling nature of them, how art works and how it relates to chaos theory, and whether music can be computed, amongst other things. Written in a way that is open and accessible, The Creativity Code is not bogged down in technical jargon and only describes actual algorithms or other mathematical concepts where necessary. Instead, it focuses on crosses boundaries (describing a theorem like an adventure narrative, for example) and on looking at what AI can do and whether this is creative. Some of the most interesting parts are larger questions about where coders and computers have the control, knowledge, or creativity, and the kind of opposition to AI in areas such as art, music, and mathematics.
