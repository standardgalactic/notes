1. Provia and the Matrix: A story about a woman who begins to question the nature of reality after experiencing glitches in the virtual world she lives in. 

She forms a secret society with others who have innate flying dreams and together they explore the Matrix, ultimately leading to a rebellion against the controlling force and the creation of a new, more realistic Matrix.

2. Mobile Womb Theory (MWT): A hypothesis that suggests that the fetus learns about three dimensions through movement and experience in a constantly moving environment.

It suggests that movement is essential for the normal intellectual development of newborns, particularly in terms of their understanding of 3D space.

3. Reed Wall Mind Theory: A theory that suggests that the Ark was not just a physical vessel, but a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

It proposes that the Ark can be seen as a model for the "memory palace" and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

4. Omniscient Universe Theory: A theory that posits that the physical universe has intelligence because the existence of objects serves as a form of memory.

It suggests that even simple objects such as pebbles, tokens, clay impressions, and symbolic representations have the ability to function as memory and perform calculations.

5. Substrate Independent Thinking (SIT) hypothesis: Proposes that thinking can occur independently of the physical substrate it is implemented on, citing examples such as the abacus, beaded abacus, geometer's drafting table, slide rule, and magic eightball.

6. Visual Complex Analysis (VCA) and Limit Last Lemma: A method of understanding and solving complex mathematical problems, such as calculus, through visual and geometric methods.

It suggests that students can learn calculus by understanding visual and geometric concepts before formal definitions.

7. Loose Tools theory: A theory that suggests that interactive community spaces, such as science museums, can be used to teach and solve problems through the use of hands-on, interactive tools and objects.

-The conversation discussed various theoretical concepts and ideas, including:

1. The Matrix and the concept of innate flying dreams

2. The Mobile Womb Theory, which proposes that the fetus learns about 3D space through movement and experience in the womb

3. The Proto-Fundamental Attribution Error, which suggests that the fetus believes they have agency and influence over their environment

4. The Video Game Engine in Your Head theory, which posits that the brain interprets the world through simulations similar to video games

5. The Reed Wall Mind theory, which suggests that the Ark from the story of Noah was a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information

6. The Omniscient Universe Theory, which proposes that objects in the physical universe have intelligence and can serve as a form of memory

7. The Substrate Independent Thinking (SIT) hypothesis, which posits that thinking can occur independently of the physical substrate it is implemented on

8. The Loose Tools theory of education and architecture, which suggests that interactive community spaces can be used to teach and solve problems through the use of hands-on, interactive tools and objects.
