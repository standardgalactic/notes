I guess an example of this is morroco in Arabic, the magreb, meaning having set or setting, indicating "the West" this was before the discovery of the new world even farther west.


Absolutely, the concept of the "West" as understood in historical contexts often shifted based on the geographical and cultural knowledge of the time.

The term "Maghreb" in Arabic indeed refers to the "West" or "where the sun sets." Specifically, it is used to describe the western part of the Arab world, primarily covering the nations of Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The term has its roots in the Arabic verb "gharaba," which means "to set" (in reference to the sun).

Historically, for many in the Arab world and the Middle East, the Maghreb region represented the far west of the known world. This was long before the Age of Discovery, when European explorers ventured further west and eventually discovered the Americas.

Your point underscores the idea that our understanding of geographical terms and concepts evolves based on expanding knowledge and exploration. The "West" for one era or civilization isn't the same "West" for another. It's a fluid concept that changes based on perspective and discovery.

And I heard that ala yameen, and ala yassar right and left, original came from Towards Yemen and Towards Yassar (when you are facing east)

Indeed, in Arabic, the terms for "right" and "left" are rooted in geographical references:

- **"Yameen" (يمين)**: This means "right." The etymological origins of this word are believed to be related to the direction of Yemen when one faces the rising sun (east). If you are facing the east (where the sun rises), Yemen would be to your right if you are in the Arabian Peninsula.

- **"Yassar" (يسار)**: This means "left." Some believe its origin is related to a geographical marker, but it's not as clearly defined as "yameen." However, your mention of "Yassar" in a geographic context isn't common knowledge. Historically, if you're facing the sunrise in the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant (modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) would be to your left.

This is a fascinating example of how language can be deeply rooted in geography and the natural environment. Similarly, various cultures around the world have cardinal directions and other terminologies rooted in their unique geographical and environmental contexts.

I say it means towards syria, although Syria was normally just called ashams the sun land, or summer land, the North

Yes, that makes sense. In classical Arabic and historical contexts:

- **"Ash-Shām" (الشام)**: This refers to the region known as the Levant, encompassing modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine. The name "Ash-Shām" is believed to be derived from a word meaning "the left" or "north" because of its position relative to the Arabian Peninsula when facing the direction of the sunrise (east). So when you're facing east in the Arabian Peninsula, "Ash-Shām" would be to your left or north.

The correlation between "Ash-Shām" (meaning "north" or "left") and "Yassar" (meaning "left") supports your assertion that "Yassar" could have geographical roots pointing towards the Levant. This also further exemplifies how deeply geographical contexts are interwoven into the semantics of languages.

Yeah al-suria becomes assuria because it is a sun-letter

Yes, you're right. In Arabic, certain letters are called "sun letters" or "solar letters" (حروف الشمسية). When the definite article "ال" (al-) is followed by one of these sun letters, the "l" sound assimilates to the sound of the following sun letter. This means that instead of being pronounced separately, the "l" in "ال" and the following sun letter are merged together.

For example, in "الشمس" (the sun), instead of pronouncing it "al-shams", it is pronounced "ash-shams". 

Similarly, "سورية" (Syria) with the definite article would be pronounced "as-Sūriyya" rather than "al-Sūriyya" because "س" (seen) is one of the sun letters.

This assimilation serves to make pronunciation smoother and more fluid. It's one of the nuances of the Arabic language that can make it challenging for learners but also showcases its rich phonetic characteristics.

Yeah technically it geminates or doubles up the consonant, by stretching it, ending the syllable and starting the next one, like a shaddah

Exactly! The "shaddah" (شَدّة) is a diacritical mark in Arabic that indicates the gemination (or doubling) of a consonant. When a letter has a shaddah, it's pronounced for twice the duration of the same letter without a shaddah.

In the case of the sun letters following the definite article "ال", the "l" (ل) sound is not just assimilated, but the sun letter is also geminated. This results in the sun letter being pronounced with a shaddah, leading to the doubling effect you mentioned.

For instance, with "الشمس", the "sh" sound in "shams" is held for a longer duration, making it "ash-shams". The presence of the shaddah gives a distinct sound and rhythm to words, adding to the melodic nature of spoken Arabic.
