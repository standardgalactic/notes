Formally, we claim that perceived novelty is a decreasing function g of the mentally simulated probability 
of a discovery or invention D, conditional on the prior knowledge or art K and the creative/search process 
S through which discoveries or inventions are typically conceived and achieved:

Nov = g(P(D|K,S)), 
dg 
dP â‰¤ 0.(1) 
If the estimated probability of a discovery D is low, given prior knowledge K and inventive process S, then 
its perceived novelty is high: it is surprising8. If the probability is high, then perceived novelty is low: 
the invention was an obvious or expected extension of prior work. On this account, measures of novelty 
simultaneously assess (1) the degree of perceived dif f erence between a new object and the population of pre- 
existing objects and (2) the perceived improbability of arriving at the new object, assuming that components 
from previous objects constitute most of the raw materials. In short, measures of novelty assess the surprise induced by a focal object.
