The Principle of Indifference of Laplace states that equipossible alternatives may be accorded equal probabilities if nothing more is known about the underlying probability distribution. However, it is a matter of contention whether the concept of equipossibility, also called equispecificity (from equispecific), can truly be distinguished from the concept of equiprobability[citation needed].

In Bayesian inference, one definition of equipossibility is "a transformation group which leaves invariant one's state of knowledge". Equiprobability is then defined by normalizing the Haar measure of this symmetry group[citation needed]. This is known as the principle of transformation groups.
