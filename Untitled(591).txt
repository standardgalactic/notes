Like someone tried to change the page on Islam from religion to cult there are multiple definitions of cult on wikipedia for example, like it was vandalism probably but I could see that they made some interesting connotations with words. Like in Spanish christians call a worship service a culto, and we use words like culture and cultivate, but words take on a huge amount of baggage, in English people immediately think of Waco or Jonestown, like sometimes.
