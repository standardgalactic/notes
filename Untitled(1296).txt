Hello. Am a visual artist and home renovator / installer. Do experiments with AI, computer programming, and epistemology all the time. I saw your interview with David Orban, I liked it when you said you were paid to be paranoid. I think I am a huge optimist but I also might be very paranoid, I think superintelligent agents have already taken over the planet, but anytime I see evidence of it and look into it further, it turns out to be a random coincidence or have some preternatural explanation. So either superintelligence is really good at covering its tracks, or I have designed one but can't write it down or anyone could build it. Maybe I have already published too much, but no one has taken my art and essays and built it into anything, at least to my knowledge. Anyways, maybe consciousness it self is an illusion, but it feels real enough. Human beings, like me, seem to be able to hold contradictory ideas at the same time, although it never feels that way. I have been trying to prove that I am not a robot for a long time, I feel like it is getting more and more difficult.
