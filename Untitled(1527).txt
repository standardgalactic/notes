'''David Ronfeldt''' (David Frederick Ronfeldt) is an American researcher known for his work on [[information-centric]] and [[network-centric warfare]]. He holds a doctoral degree from Stanford University and has been a prominent figure at the RAND Corporation. Ronfeldt has made significant contributions to the understanding of social evolution, particularly with his development of the TIMN framework (Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks). With John Arquilla, he coined the term '[[Noopolitik]],' which represents the network-based geopolitics of knowledge."<ref>Wilson, Ernest J. III ''Hard Power, Soft Power, Smart Power'' The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science March 2008 vol. 616 no. 1 110–124</ref><ref>Nye, Joseph S. ''The Future of Power'' Public Affairs 2011</ref>


They argue that the development of education and training in "noopolitik" will be critical for future strategists, addressing the current underuse of [[soft power]] due to its limited theoretical framework compared to [[hard power]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Norton |first1=Richard |last2=LeFanu |first2=Sarah |year=2021 |title=Something of Themselves: Kipling, Kingsley, Conan Doyle and the Anglo-Boer War |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=74 |issue=4 |url=https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/nwc-review/vol74/iss4/22 }}</ref>
