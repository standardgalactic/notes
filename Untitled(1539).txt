Introduction to ğŸ”—ğŸŒ³ and MERA:

Tree Tensor Networks (ğŸ”—ğŸŒ³) are hierarchical structures resembling binary trees.

ğŸ”—ğŸŒ³s are efficient due to their loop-free structure.

Multi-scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (ğŸ”®ğŸ“‰) is a type of ğŸ”®ğŸ“‰ designed for systems with long-range correlations.
