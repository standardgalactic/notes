the skies beneath laugh.
the happiness they faked
burned up in an instant,
evaporated into thin air,
into huge, looming grey skies
blocking out the sun
and using such successes to
take away hope

up and down,
round and round,
so life turns
and rides.
the people who
thought life was
a roller coaster,
pure thrill, no destination,
were sadly disappointed
to find that in fact
it was more a train,
whose switch
was always in their hand
to direct it's course
where they wished
they ignored it,
the train never strayed from its course,
and ended up exactly where it was headed
