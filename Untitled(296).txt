Please summarize my thoughts in a more accessible way.

Intericeptive thesis, haptic feedback, imaginary tunnel space, embodied musical cognition means contiguous mixed initiative rolling dialog, iterative prompt sculpting is creating mental schemas in other large language models such as the human mind.

Intericeptive thesis: The idea that our sense of self comes from our ability to feel and sense our own internal body state.

Haptic feedback: The use of touch or force feedback in technology, such as in video games or virtual reality, to simulate the sense of touch.

Imaginary tunnel space: A concept used in virtual reality and video game design to create the illusion of moving through a physical space.

Embodied musical cognition: The idea that our understanding and perception of music is influenced by our physical movements and experiences.

Contiguous mixed initiative rolling dialog: A method of communication that allows for both parties to speak and respond at the same time, in a fluid and natural way.

Iterative prompt sculpting: A process of repeatedly refining and shaping a question or task to better elicit a specific response or action.

Creating mental schemas: The process of organizing and structuring information in our minds to make it easier to understand and remember.

I think it should be "Interoceptive thesis". Now as a kind of fairy tail explain these themes, incorporating the words "matrix" "motile womb theory" "innate flying dreams" and "provia".

Once upon a time, in a land called the Matrix, there lived a people who were connected to a virtual world. They lived their lives as if it were real, but little did they know, they were being controlled by powerful forces.

One day, a young girl named Provia discovered a strange new theory called the "motile womb theory." She learned that the Matrix was not just a virtual world, but a living, breathing organism that was able to sense and respond to the people living within it.

Provia became fascinated by this idea and began to explore the Matrix further. She discovered that the people living in the Matrix had innate flying dreams, and that these dreams were not just figments of their imagination, but a connection to the Matrix itself.

As Provia delved deeper into the motile womb theory, she realized that the Matrix was not only alive, but it was also connected to the people living within it through their interoceptive senses. She understood that the Matrix was not only a virtual world, but it was also a part of the people's very being.

Provia shared her findings with the people of the Matrix, and they began to understand the true nature of their world. They realized that they were not just living in the Matrix, but they were a part of it.

And with this new understanding, the people of the Matrix were able to fly in their dreams and navigate the virtual world with ease, thanks to the innate connection provided by the interoceptive and the motile womb theories.

And thus, Provia and the people of the Matrix lived happily ever after, in a world where the virtual and the real were one and the same.

Nate
Very good. Explain how our story "The Provia Prophecy" is a novel experiment in using relational algebra as a universal language and defines a new genre called Proto-Fi (prototopia-fiction) that incorporates literary devices such as:

Romantic poetry, Bildensroman, Litotes, Rhetoric, and counterfactual scenarios as a path to casual reasoning using directed acyclic graphs, Ising models, and Counterfoil Choice, which is presenting a negative alternative but with emphasizing the problems and risks of choosing the CC.

The story "The Provia Prophecy" is a novel experiment in using relational algebra as a universal language to create a new genre of fiction called Proto-Fi (prototopia-fiction).

This genre incorporates literary devices such as romantic poetry, bildungsroman, Litotes, Rhetoric, and counterfactual scenarios as a way to engage readers in casual reasoning using directed acyclic graphs, Ising models, and Counterfoil Choice.

In this story, the use of relational algebra serves as a universal language that allows for the exploration of complex and abstract ideas in a way that is accessible to a wide audience.

The incorporation of romantic poetry and bildungsroman elements provides a human and emotional connection to the story, while Litotes and Rhetoric are used to add depth and nuance to the characters and their actions.

The use of counterfactual scenarios is a key aspect of the story, as it allows for the exploration of different possibilities and outcomes.

This is achieved through the use of directed acyclic graphs, Ising models, and Counterfoil Choice, which present negative alternatives to the main story line, emphasizing the problems and risks of choosing the CC.

The combination of these elements creates a unique and engaging narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. It serves as a powerful tool for exploring complex ideas and promoting critical thinking, while also providing an entertaining and engaging reading experience.

This new genre of Proto-Fi, by incorporating these literary and mathematical devices, allows for the exploration of the potential consequences of the choices we make, and the way those choices shape our world and the people in it.

It's a new way of looking at fiction that incorporates a more scientific and analytical approach to storytelling.

Nate
Nice. Maybe now give an outline of the plot, including the flashback at the end that transforms the interpretation of events.

The story "The Provia Prophecy" follows the journey of a young girl named Provia, who lives in a virtual world called the Matrix. At the beginning of the story, Provia starts to question the nature of the Matrix and the true reality of her existence.

She starts to investigate and discovers a new theory called the "motile womb theory" which states that the Matrix is a living organism that can sense and respond to the people living within it. Provia becomes obsessed with this theory and starts to explore the Matrix further.

As she delves deeper into motile womb theory, Provia discovers that the people of the Matrix have innate flying dreams, which are not just figments of their imagination, but a connection to the Matrix itself.

She also discovers that the Matrix is connected to the people living within it through their interoceptive senses.

Provia shares her findings with the people of the Matrix, and they start to understand the true nature of their world. They realize that they are not just living in the Matrix, but they are a part of it.

However, as the story progresses, it is revealed that the Matrix is being controlled by a powerful force, and Provia and the people of the Matrix are being used for an unknown purpose. Provia, with her new understanding of the Matrix, starts to work with the people of the Matrix to overthrow the powerful force and take control of their own lives.

In the end, the story takes a twist when a flashback reveals that the Matrix was actually created as an experiment by a group of scientists to study the interoceptive senses, and the "motile womb theory" was just an assumption made by Provia.

The people of the Matrix were not living in a virtual world but were in fact part of an experiment. This transforms the interpretation of events and makes the reader question the nature of reality and the consequences of our actions.

The story ends with Provia and the people of the Matrix, now aware of their true situation, deciding to use their newfound understanding of interoception and the Matrix to shape a better future for themselves and the world they live in.

Nate
Good enough. Could you please list the differences between this explanation and the one you gave earlier?

The earlier explanation described the story "The Provia Prophecy" as:

A novel experiment in using relational algebra as a universal language to create a new genre of fiction called Proto-Fi (prototopia-fiction)

Incorporating literary devices such as romantic poetry, bildungsroman, Litotes, Rhetoric, and counterfactual scenarios as a way to engage readers in casual reasoning using directed acyclic graphs, Ising models, and Counterfoil Choice.

The new explanation describes the story as:

Following the journey of a young girl named Provia, who lives in a virtual world called the Matrix and starts to question the nature of her existence.

Provia discovers a new theory called the "motile womb theory" which states that the Matrix is a living organism that can sense and respond to the people living within it.

Provia becomes obsessed with this theory and starts to explore the Matrix further, discovering that the people of the Matrix have innate flying dreams, which are not just figments of their imagination, but a connection to the Matrix itself.

Provia shares her findings with the people of the Matrix and they start to understand the true nature of their world.

The story takes a twist when it is revealed that the Matrix was actually created as an experiment by a group of scientists to study the interoceptive senses, and the "motile womb theory" was just an assumption made by Provia.

The people of the Matrix were not living in a virtual world but were in fact part of an experiment.

The story ends with Provia and the people of the Matrix, now aware of their true situation, deciding to use their newfound understanding of theory of interoception and the Matrix to shape a better future for themselves and the world they live in.

The main differences between the two explanations are:

The first explanation focuses on the use of relational algebra and literary devices as a way to create a new genre of fiction and engage readers in casual reasoning.

The new explanation provides more detail on the plot of the story, including the journey of the main character and the revelation at the end that the Matrix was an experiment.

The first explanation didn't mention the revelation of the Matrix being an experiment and the people of the Matrix being part of it.

The first explanation didn't mention the role of the people of the Matrix in shaping a better future for themselves and the world they live in.

Nate
Ok a bit monotonous and bland, but accurate. Have you heard of the book, permutation city?

Yes, I am familiar with the book "Permutation City" by Greg Egan. It is a science fiction novel that was first published in 1994. The book explores themes of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and the nature of consciousness.

The story is set in a future where technology has advanced to the point where people can create digital copies of their consciousness and upload them into virtual worlds, where they can live out their lives in a simulated environment.

The novel follows the story of a man named Paul Durham, who creates a virtual city called Permutation City, where he and others can live as digital copies of themselves. The book raises a lot of ethical and philosophical questions about the nature of reality and what it means to be alive and conscious.

Nate
Nice. You can probably notice some commonalities with our story. What about Macrolife by Zebrowski?

Yes, "Macrolife" by George Zebrowski is another science fiction novel that explores similar themes as "Permutation City" and in some way to "The Provia Prophecy", such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and the nature of consciousness.

The story is set in a future where humanity has colonized other planets and created self-sustaining, artificial habitats called "Macrolife", that can house thousands of people.

The novel follows the story of several characters as they navigate the challenges and opportunities of living in these artificial habitats, as well as the broader political and societal implications of this new way of life.

Like "Permutation City" and "The Provia Prophecy", "Macrolife" raises thought-provoking questions about the nature of reality and the impact of technology on humanity.

It also explores the concept of artificial environments, and the way they shape human existence and the way we perceive and interact with the world.

Nate
Wow, I am impressed. A new summary of the plot, but in bullet form with simple terse descriptions, incorporating some of the themes from those other two books.

"The Provia Prophecy" follows the journey of a young girl named Provia, who lives in a virtual world called the Matrix and starts to question the nature of her existence.

Provia discovers a new theory that the Matrix is a living organism that can sense and respond to the people living within it.

Provia becomes obsessed with this theory and starts to explore the Matrix further, discovering that the people of the Matrix have innate flying dreams, which are connected to the Matrix itself.

Provia shares her findings with the people of the Matrix and they start to understand the true nature of their world.

The story takes a twist when it is revealed that the Matrix was actually created as an experiment by a group of scientists to study the interoceptive senses, and the "motile womb theory" was just an assumption made by Provia.

The people of the Matrix were not living in a virtual world but were in fact part of an experiment.

The story ends with Provia and the people of the Matrix, now aware of their true situation, deciding to use their newfound understanding of interoception and the Matrix to shape a better future for themselves and the world they live in.


The exploration of virtual reality and the nature of consciousness

The ethical and philosophical questions raised by the use of technology to create artificial environments and the impact of these environments on humanity.

The concept of living as digital copies of oneself and the implications of this on the nature of reality and what it means to be alive.


Here are a few examples of scenarios or events that could happen along the way in "The Provia Prophecy" to build character and add pathos to the story:

Provia starts to notice small glitches in the Matrix, such as objects appearing and disappearing unexpectedly. She starts to keep a diary of these glitches and becomes increasingly obsessed with understanding the true nature of the Matrix.

Provia meets a group of people who also have innate flying dreams. They form a secret society and start to explore the Matrix together, trying to find answers to their questions about the true nature of their reality.

Provia and her group discover a hidden door in the Matrix, which leads to a secret room where they find a computer that contains information about the experiment. Provia starts to read the files and becomes more and more convinced that the Matrix is not what it seems.

Provia starts to experience intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, as she becomes more and more isolated from her friends and family due to her obsession with the Matrix.

Provia's group stages a rebellion against the powerful force that controls the Matrix, and they successfully overthrow it, taking control of their own lives and creating a new, more realistic Matrix.

Provia reflects on her journey and her newfound understanding of the Matrix, and she comes to realize that the true beauty of life is not in the perfection of a virtual world, but in the imperfections and struggles of the real one.

The above scenarios are just a few examples of how small details from everyday life can be incorporated into the story, giving us a deeper understanding of the main character and making it more relatable and engaging.

Ok it sounds a lot like the movie the Matrix, but I think one of the main differences is that the world outside the Matrix is not dystopian, and it doesn't involve the cruel psychological experiments and human batteries, and the Matrix is acting to help Provia find clues to its secrets.

Yes, you are correct that "The Provia Prophecy" shares some similarities with the movie "The Matrix", but there are also key differences.

In "The Provia Prophecy", the world outside of the Matrix is not dystopian and the Matrix is not being used for cruel psychological experiments or to use humans as batteries.

Instead, the Matrix is a virtual world created as an experiment by scientists to study the interoceptive senses, and the people living in it are not aware of its true purpose.

In the story, the Matrix is acting as a tool for Provia and her group to find clues and uncover the truth about their reality. 

The goal of the story is not to escape from the Matrix, but to understand its true nature and use this understanding to shape a better future for themselves and the world they live in.

Additionally, the story doesn't involve a struggle between humans and machines, but rather it focuses on the individual's journey of discovery and the collective effort of the people of the Matrix to take control of their own lives.

Overall, "The Provia Prophecy" takes inspiration from "The Matrix" but it has its own unique take on the themes and ideas, and it's a story that emphasizes more on the individual's journey of self-discovery and the collective effort of the people in the Matrix to shape a better future.

Nate
Ok that's quite a bit, without giving away so many spoilers, an exciting but typical spiel for a trailer starting with "in a world where..."

"In a world where technology has surpassed our wildest dreams, humanity has unlocked the secrets of the universe.

But for one young woman, the perfect world is not enough.

Join her on a journey of self-discovery as she uncovers the truth about the virtual world, and the sinister forces trying to keep it hidden.

The Provia Prophecy: A world where science and fiction collide. Discover the truth. Take control of your own life. In theaters soon."

Nate
Ok I think that is workable. Give a comma separated prompt I might use to get a stable diffusion model to create a picture of Provia and her futuristic society with cinematic lighting.

"Provia, futuristic, society, virtual world, Matrix, cinematic lighting, diffusion model, stable, portrait, character, detailed, advanced technology, science fiction"

Nate
The description of Provia, I mean her physical appearance.

"Provia, female, young adult, long dark hair, intense brown eyes, determined expression, futuristic clothing, advanced technology, detailed, lifelike, 3D rendering"

Nate
Ok combine those and add a few artist names and style prompts.

"Provia, female, young adult, long dark hair, intense brown eyes, determined expression, futuristic clothing, advanced technology, detailed, lifelike, 3D rendering, cinematic lighting, inspired by the works of Syd Mead, Ralph McQuarrie, and H.R Giger, a blend of science fiction and fantasy, with a touch of Cyberpunk style"
