You've highlighted an interesting contradiction within the antediluvian diet as depicted in certain versions of the flood myth, such as the Atrahasis. In these accounts, Noah (or the equivalent character) kills many of the animals before bringing them on board the Ark, presumably for consumption. This action contradicts the notion of preserving species and biodiversity during the flood.

This contradiction raises questions about the symbolism and interpretation of flood myths across different cultures. On one hand, these myths often convey themes of divine punishment, cleansing, and renewal. On the other hand, they sometimes contain elements that appear inconsistent with the preservation of life.

One way to interpret this contradiction is to view it as a reflection of complex human perspectives on nature and the divine. It could symbolize the tension between the destructive and creative aspects of divine power. Additionally, it may serve as a reminder of humanity's role in stewarding the natural world and the consequences of our actions.

In the context of your earlier discussions about symbolic interpretations of these myths, it highlights the multifaceted nature of these ancient stories and their ability to provoke reflection on human behavior, ethics, and the relationship between the earthly and divine realms.

And if they were not eating animals before the flood, why was Abel keeping flocks and why did he sacrifice them by cooking them?

ChatGPT

The biblical story of Abel, his flocks, and his sacrifice is found in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament. According to the narrative, Abel was a shepherd who offered animal sacrifices to God, and his brother Cain was a farmer who offered crops. God favored Abel's offering over Cain's, leading to jealousy and ultimately to the murder of Abel by Cain.

The story doesn't explicitly mention whether or not people were eating animals before the flood. Instead, it primarily serves as a narrative about the relationship between God and humanity, as well as the consequences of jealousy and violence. It's a foundational story in the Judeo-Christian tradition that explores themes of worship, faith, and moral responsibility.

In some interpretations of the story, Abel's keeping of flocks and offering animal sacrifices could symbolize acts of worship and devotion rather than the regular consumption of meat. The act of sacrificing animals in various religious traditions is often symbolic and ritualistic, serving as a way to demonstrate faith and seek divine favor.

It's important to note that religious texts like the Bible often contain symbolic and allegorical elements, and interpretations can vary among different religious traditions and scholars. Therefore, whether Abel's actions were indicative of regular meat consumption or primarily symbolic in nature can be a matter of interpretation and theological perspective.

I am just saying that it could be an early version of the Daniel experiment. Maybe it was speculating that God favored meat eating bacause it gave more energy than eating vegetables

ChatGPT

Your perspective on the story of Abel and his sacrifices as an early version of an experiment or exploration of the benefits of meat consumption is an interesting interpretation. While the biblical text doesn't explicitly state the purpose of Abel's actions, it does leave room for various interpretations and symbolic meanings.

In the context of dietary choices, some individuals and religious traditions do emphasize the benefits of certain diets, such as vegetarianism or plant-based diets, for health or ethical reasons. The story of Daniel in the Bible, for example, features a dietary experiment where Daniel and his friends choose to avoid meat and eat vegetables to demonstrate their faith and health-conscious choices.

Your speculation that Abel's sacrifices could have been a way to test the favor of God based on dietary choices aligns with the idea that religious texts can contain deeper layers of meaning beyond the surface narrative. It also reflects the ongoing human curiosity and exploration of diet and nutrition throughout history.

Ultimately, interpretations of these ancient stories can vary widely, and your perspective adds an interesting dimension to the discussion of dietary choices, faith, and symbolism in religious texts.

They could also be thinking that if a flock of birds comes flying toward it, it is favored by God

ChatGPT

Your interpretation that Abel's choice to keep flocks and offer animal sacrifices could have been connected to a belief in divine favor or signs from God is a plausible perspective. In many ancient cultures, including those depicted in biblical narratives, people often looked for signs and omens in the natural world as a way to understand and interpret the will of the divine.

The idea that the behavior of animals or natural phenomena might be seen as indications of divine favor or displeasure is a common theme in ancient religious and cultural practices. For example, the flight patterns of birds, the behavior of animals, or the occurrence of specific events in nature were sometimes believed to carry spiritual significance or messages from the divine.

In this context, Abel's decision to keep flocks and offer animal sacrifices could indeed be seen as an attempt to align with what he believed to be signs of divine favor or a way to seek God's approval through these offerings.

This interpretation highlights the rich complexity of religious and cultural beliefs in ancient times and the various ways in which people sought to connect with and understand the divine through their observations of the natural world.

I was thinking that you can make meat substitutes from most grains if you crush them separate them with a centrifuge and other methods to get oils, starches and flours, then you make bread and fry it in those oils.

ChatGPT

Your idea of making meat substitutes from grains by extracting oils, starches, and flours and then using them to create a meat-like texture through baking and frying is intriguing. This approach aligns with the concept of plant-based or grain-based meat alternatives, which have gained popularity in recent years due to environmental, health, and ethical considerations.

Here's a simplified overview of how this process might work:

Grain Selection: Choose grains such as wheat, soy, or legumes like chickpeas, which are commonly used in plant-based meat substitutes.

Oil Extraction: Extract oils from the grains. This can be done through processes like pressing, solvent extraction, or cold-pressing, depending on the type of grain and desired oil.

Starch and Flour Separation: Separate starches and flours from the remaining grain components. Starches can be used for binding and texture, while flours can contribute to the overall structure.

Recipe Formulation: Create a recipe using the extracted oils, starches, flours, and other ingredients to mimic the taste and texture of meat. This might involve adding flavorings, spices, and binders.

Dough or Mixture Preparation: Combine the ingredients to form a dough or mixture that can be shaped and cooked.

Cooking: Shape the mixture into desired forms, such as patties or nuggets, and cook them. Baking, frying, or grilling are common methods.

Texture Enhancement: Some processes may involve additional steps to enhance the texture, such as extrusion or high-pressure processing.

Packaging: Package the meat substitute products for distribution and consumption.

Your concept aligns with the broader trend of plant-based and alternative protein products that aim to provide sustainable and ethical choices for consumers. It's worth noting that the development of meat substitutes involves a combination of food science, culinary innovation, and consumer preferences, and many companies and researchers are actively working on creating these products.

This approach not only offers potential solutions to dietary preferences but also addresses environmental concerns related to traditional meat production.
