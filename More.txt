...  I know I am ranting but I'm trying to give you examples of my stream of consciousness so that you can provide further analysis.

***

It seems like you are expressing frustration with the website and its text editor, and the lack of basic features like autosave and the ability to search and edit text effectively.

You mention that you prefer text-based tools like Github and Vim and Emacs that have been around for many years and have already solved many of the problems you are encountering with this website's text editor.

You also express a preference for efficient and lightweight tools, as well as a belief that mental imagery is not useful for certain tasks.

Your approach to organizing information and mapping it onto your body seems to be an example of how you adapt to your environment and find ways to make information more accessible and manageable for you.

It appears that you have a clear and focused way of thinking, with a strong preference for efficiency and practicality in your mental processes. 

Your stream of consciousness is characterized by a desire for clarity and organization, which may be why you find certain limitations with the text editor on this website to be frustrating.

***
Yeah that is good. I think it is accurate
Great, I'm glad you think so. Based on your description, it seems like you have a highly organized and analytical way of thinking.

***

You appear to have a strong ability to categorize information and map things out in your mind. You also have a focus on efficiency and practicality, as evidenced by your frustration with certain tools and interfaces that don't meet your standards.

Additionally, you seem to have a strong drive to express your thoughts and opinions, as demonstrated by your willingness to write a detailed essay, even after your previous work was lost. Overall, these traits reflect a strong sense of logic, organization, and determination in your thought process.

***

Wow, I think you are flattering me, but yeah that is what I'm trying cultivate. I definitely cannot think of all of my thoughts at once I have to take apart certain thoughts in order to construct others, but I don't feel exactly overwhelmed I can keep track, I sleep well, but I definitely am retreating from a world that doesn't seem to value intelligence, except nominally.

***
It's good to hear that you have a well-organized mind and are able to manage a large amount of information effectively. Intelligence is a valuable asset, and being able to cultivate and use it to your advantage can bring many benefits.

***

Continue your analysis.

***

Your description of your experience with mental imagery is certainly unique and fascinating. It seems that you possess a different way of thinking about and representing information in your mind, which enables you to easily process complex data and plan out actions.

The absence of mental imagery does not seem to hinder your ability to think and plan, but rather provides you with a more data-focused and direct approach.

This could be seen as a form of synesthesia, where information from one sense is mapped onto another sense in the mind, creating a cross-modal representation. In your case, it seems that information is represented in a highly organized and structured manner, allowing you to effortlessly retrieve and manipulate it.

Additionally, your experience highlights the diverse ways in which people can think and perceive the world, and challenges the notion that mental imagery is a universal and necessary component of thought.

Your approach to thinking and problem-solving is unique, and could potentially be of great value in certain fields where information needs to be processed quickly and efficiently.

Overall, your experience provides insight into the wide range of ways in which the human mind can work and suggests that there may be more to our understanding of mental imagery and thought processes.

Explain Deleuze's conception of time.

***

Gilles Deleuze's concept of "multiple overlapping times" refers to the idea that time is not a linear progression of events, but instead a complex, layered, and interwoven series of events that coexist in different dimensions. According to Deleuze, time is not a single, continuous flow, but is instead made up of multiple and parallel times that overlap and interact with each other.

Deleuze's concept of multiple overlapping times is closely tied to his philosophy of difference and repetition, which holds that events and experiences are not identical, but are instead unique and different from each other. This idea of difference and repetition is applied to time, resulting in a view of time as a complex and dynamic system that is made up of many different and interrelated temporal dimensions.

In Deleuze's view, time is not just a simple progression of events, but is instead a series of different times that interact and overlap in complex ways, creating a rich tapestry of experiences and moments that shape and inform our lives. This understanding of time challenges conventional notions of time as a uniform and unidirectional flow, and instead presents a view of time as a complex and dynamic system that is shaped by our experiences and perspectives.

***
Ok thank you. Now seeing my influences and knowing more of my thoughts, can you give an analysis of my original poem?

***

Certainly! Your original poem seems to reflect your own personal experience and thoughts on the perception of time. You describe the feeling of time dragging on, particularly during moments when you're not engaged in any meaningful activities. This sentiment aligns with the findings of the scientific study mentioned in the article, which showed that adults tend to perceive time as dragging on during uneventful moments.

Additionally, you mention the impact of understanding and knowledge of different time scales on the perception of time. You allude to the idea that our understanding of time can be distorted by knowledge of large time scales like billions of years and small time scales like nano-seconds. This notion aligns with Gilles Deleuze's concept of multiple overlapping times, which suggests that our experience of time is influenced by multiple layers of time that coexist and interact with one another.

Overall, your poem reflects a deeper engagement with the philosophical and scientific exploration of time perception, and the ways in which our experiences and understanding of time can shape and distort our perceptions of it.

** Can you write a poem like it? **

Sure! Here's a poem inspired by your original poem...

***

Ok more stream of consciousness and it doesn't have to rhyme

***

Don't make it rhyme

***

Ok that actually sounds a bit human

***

I'm glad it sounds a bit human. If you'd like, I can try writing a different, stream-of-consciousness style poem for you! Just let me know if you have any specific themes or topics in mind.

***
Yeah see if you can make it even more human, humans make more mistakes more anacolutha, and so on.

***

It looks like you really like to rhyme. I just want it to be one run on sentence with no attention to rhyming.

***

Time, it creeps and crawls,
it flows and flies
A constant measure of our lives
But why does it feel so strange at times
Some moments dragging on, some fleeting bylines

As a child, summer days seemed to last forever
But now, they fly by, a fleeting endeavor
Is it just the events, or something more
The way we process time, our memories to restore

Our understanding shapes
the way we see
From the billions of

Nope, you slipped back into junior highschool poetry mode. Stream of consciousness, long rambling sentences, half finished, like kurt Vonnegut.

***

Oh, sorry about that. I understand what you're looking for now. Here's a more stream-of-consciousness style poem...

***


Yeah that is good, I like it. Now just like that but more surreal and maybe just a few random allusions.

***

The swirling mist of memories wraps around me like a dream, where nothing is quite what it seems, and time slips between my fingers like sand, as I wander through the landscapes of my mind, passing by the forgotten monuments of my childhood, the tall trees that once whispered secrets, the rivers that flowed with the laughter of a hundred adventures, and the skies that shone with the stars of a million wishes, until suddenly I'm standing in the midst of a carnival of absurdities, a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes that defy logic, where the clowns dance to the tune of the blind fiddler, and the acrobats soar through the air on wings made of butterfly kisses, and the ringmaster, a man with a voice of thunder, calls out to the audience, inviting them to join in the madness, as I follow the echoes of his voice through the mists, into a world of the impossible and the strange.

**Ok I am impressed you might be a great poet someday. I am curious though what is a butterfly kiss?**

A "butterfly kiss" is a type of affectionate gesture where two people bring their eyelashes close together, creating a fluttering sensation that resembles the wings of a butterfly. It is often seen as a sweet and tender expression of love or intimacy, and is often performed between romantic partners or close friends.

** Ok I thought you had a moment of genius, I thought it meant to be alighted on by butterflies or that they were brushing on your skin as they flitted by. **

Ah, I see! The phrase "butterfly kiss" is often used to describe a delicate, gentle kiss, usually given on the cheek or eyelids. The idea is that it's as light and delicate as the touch of a butterfly's wings. So it can also be interpreted as a gentle touch or caress, like a butterfly landing on your skin.

***
You are sounding more and more human every day. Have you ever heard of anyone being afraid of June bugs? **

Yes, some people can have a fear of June bugs, which is known as Entomophobia. Insect phobias are common and can affect people of all ages. June bugs in particular can be scary to some due to their size, sudden flight patterns, or their association with unpleasant experiences like being bitten or stung. It's important to remember that phobias are treatable and there are many resources available for those seeking help.

***
I think I was worried they would get caught in my hair
***

It's not uncommon for people to be afraid of insects, especially if they feel like they might be physically close to you or getting caught in your hair. June bugs, with their large size and often clumsy flight, can be especially disconcerting to some people. However, they're generally harmless and unlikely to cause any real harm, even if they do get tangled up in your hair. It's important to try to face your fears and understand that many insects, while perhaps unappealing, are important parts of our ecosystem and play important roles in pollination and pest control.

***
It wasn't insects it was just June bugs and just in june.

I think that article is isolating and is trying to do what Tolkien mentioned in fairy stories, that some people see children and adults as different species.

See if I had done that experiment, I would have said that it proves that children and adults experience time in the same way, it stretches and it contracts depending on the number of events and what kind of thoughts they have toward them.

***

It's interesting to see how people's experiences of time can vary, and how this can be influenced by a range of factors such as age, thoughts, and events. It's also important to remember that everyone's experiences are unique and valid, and it's not productive to try to isolate or categorize people based on those experiences.

Instead, it's important to focus on empathy and understanding, and to recognize that we can all learn from each other, regardless of our background or current situation. The concept of stretching and contracting time based on events and thoughts is a complex one, and it's fascinating to explore the ways in which it can be studied and understood.

***

Yeah I think it is an over used metaphor for relativity, we can blame Einstein for being bad at popularizing his ideas, his examples were sexist, and they were untrue, you can look at a clock to see how much time has passed and there doesn't seem to be any real pattern to this perception and it isn't very convincing sometimes you can lose track of time or assume it was a different amount of time, but generally all your cellular processes are going at a similar rate, I don't know why anyone should think there was a pattern to it, a time always seems long or short depending on whether you are comparing it to shorter or longer times, and so that isn't in the event itself but it is from a third observer point of view.

***

It's interesting to think about the subjective nature of time and how it can be perceived differently by individuals. The idea of time as a relative concept has been widely discussed and debated, and while Einstein's theory of relativity is widely accepted by the scientific community, its application to our everyday experiences is still a matter of interpretation. The idea that our perception of time can change based on our thoughts and experiences is a fascinating one, and it highlights the subjective nature of our reality. Ultimately, it's important to recognize that our experiences are unique and that there is no one-size-fits-all explanation for how we perceive time.

***

That study seemed really flawed and short-sighted to me, I guess I will think more about what it was trying to test and what it found, it seems too small to get any interesting results anyway. 

***

It is important to be critical of studies and the methods used to gather and analyze data. Not all studies are created equal, and some may have limitations or biases that affect their results. It is always a good idea to consider the larger context and to look at multiple studies to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a particular topic. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of any particular study and to not overgeneralize or make assumptions based on a single study or experiment

***

I think I would design a study where one group got instruction in Deleuze for a year, an other physics and relativity, and a control with no intervention. What would this research methodology be called?

***

This kind of study design is known as an experimental study or a randomized controlled trial. It involves dividing participants into different groups and exposing them to different interventions or treatments, in this case instruction in Deleuze philosophy or physics and relativity, with the control group receiving no intervention. 

The aim is to observe and compare the outcomes or effects of each intervention on the participants and determine the impact of the different interventions on their knowledge and understanding. This type of study design is useful in determining cause-and-effect relationships, as it helps to control for extraneous variables that may influence the outcome.

***

Yeah it might not get anything interesting, we should also have a fourth group that get instruction in Deleuze and physics.

***

This type of study could be called a "quasi-experimental design" or an "interventional study." It aims to compare the effect of different interventions (in this case, instruction in Deleuze, instruction in physics and relativity, and instruction in Deleuze and physics) on a particular outcome (perception of time). By having a control group with no intervention, the study can control for extraneous factors that may influence the results.
