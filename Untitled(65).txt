Hello, this is a kind of joke application, I have little to no relevant experience or qualifications, except that I am interested in languages. I taught myself Spanish over a dozen years, am very slowly learning Arabic, and can read a little bit of ancient Greek and Latin, with some effort.

While in university I did little side project preparing the readings for a course called History of English, and I tutored and marked Intro to linguistics, Intro to Logic, early Christian philosophy, and symbolic logic and propositional calculus. So I have about four years experience kind of working as an assistant, although I hardly think it counts, and it was quite a while ago.

I also directed the art portion of a summer camp in Pennsylvania one time in like 2010, but mostly I just work for myself doing commissioned art, murals, live painting at festivals, and flipping houses with my father.

I probably would need further qualifications so I could enroll in some kind of program, I'd like to study natural language processing and designing a new Arabic keyboard although I have no idea how I would be able to afford it.

Anyways, I live up in New Brunswick so it could be kind of complicated, but maybe it might be something I'd be willing to try and maybe you won't have a lot of interested parties apply and maybe you could offer me half of whatever your next best qualified applicant is and it still might be worth it for me.

I personally think that I might be up to the job, but I am sure no one in their right mind would hire me for something like this, because it seems completely ludicrous, and I have no academic credentials (aside from a bachelor's degree) and I probably don't even want an interview because it is stressing me out a bit think about relocating and I am not that comfortable with talking on the phone or video interviews, but it could be something I'm willing to learn if it's necessary.
