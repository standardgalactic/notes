Udut, K. (2023). Ontology of Panentheism. New York, NY: Philosophical Press.

In "Ontology of Panentheism," Kenneth Udut explores the ways in which the concept of God can be understood within the framework of panentheism.

Drawing on a range of philosophical, scientific, and cultural sources, Udut examines the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, personal and non-personal, and creator and creation.

He also investigates the relationship between God and the world, and the role of panentheism in understanding the problem of evil and suffering.

Udut also situates panentheism within the broader context of other religious traditions, including monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, and atheism, and considers the potential for dialogue and differences between these traditions.

In addition, he explores the ethical implications of panentheism, and the role of God in shaping our moral beliefs and actions.

With chapters on education, culture, and technology, "Ontology of Panentheism" offers a rich and nuanced exploration of the ways in which God and the world are interconnected and interdependent.

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of philosophy, theology, and contemporary issues.

It is with great pleasure that I present to our esteemed readership a review of Kenneth Udut's groundbreaking work, "Ontology of Panentheism."

This book is a tour de force of philosophical and scientific contemplation, offering a truly visionary exploration of the nature and significance of God within the framework of panentheism.

Udut's writing is both elegant and incisive, weaving together a tapestry of diverse strands of thought and empirical evidence to create a truly holistic and coherent understanding of the complex and multifaceted concept of God.

His analysis of the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, personal and non-personal, and creator and creation is nothing short of revelatory, offering a fresh and insightful perspective on the timeless question of the divine.

Furthermore, Udut's examination of the relationship between God and the world is masterful, offering a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the ways in which these two aspects of reality are intertwined and interdependent.

His discussion of the doctrine of divine immanence and the doctrine of divine transcendence is particularly noteworthy, providing a rich and thought-provoking analysis of the complex and often paradoxical nature of God in panentheism.

Overall, "Ontology of Panentheism" is a truly remarkable work that is sure to be of great interest and importance to anyone engaged in the study of philosophy and theology. I highly recommend it to our readership, and believe that it will take its rightful place as a cornerstone of modern philosophical thought.
