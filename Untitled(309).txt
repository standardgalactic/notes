Thou shalt communicate effectively and often

Thou shalt establish clear roles and responsibilities

Thou shalt be flexible and adaptable

Thou shalt strive for continuous improvement

Thou shalt cross-train and cross-check

Thou shalt verify your own work

Thou shalt check each other's work

Thou shalt pay attention to every detail

Thou shalt not overlook final packing and shipping

Thou shalt learn from the past.
