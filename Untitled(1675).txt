It's capability. It can serve any goal. The universe is not fair. It's certainly not specifically fair to humans                   We live a very sheltered life on earth and we're stuck in a subjective bubble.   a                                                                                If you think otherwise, you're succumbing to something like the just-world fallacy.                                                                               Brian Wachter                                                                    Those are not examples of misaligned intelligence. They're outlying examples of of what happens when you abuse high                                               intelligence. This is why my approach to alignment is calm and psychological, not fearful and scientific..

With these exotic topics and developments in the world, and lots of                                      exotic ideas in my own head..it's hard to tell who's trolling or not. I try to notice whether someone argues in good faith or
not.

The fearmongering of Al x-risk tech bros, that is far                                      from dispassionate, and I suspect that it is a libertarian con to forestall political attention being paid to potential, probable                                 be                                                                               near-term harms that could be averted by regulation. If politicians are steered into focusing on regulating x-risk, there's less time for them to pay attention to near-term societal impact, which means less regulatory risk to business plans. Capitalism                                       rewards this type of "jamming" of the political system.                          Willam Davis
Brian Wachter winning wars and conquering your neighbors isn't abuse of intelligence. It's part of who we are as a species.                                       We cant get any of this right if we don't correctly understand ourselves         Brian Wachter                                                                    William Davis not what I was saying, but I totally agree with                    you.

A Superintelligence wouldn't need to be                                             hostile, just a resource hog.

The "thinking part".                   2) The motivation engine.                                                        The fact that most discussions of this topic take place in a total absence of understanding of this distinction makes almost                                      of                                                                               everything said on the matter a waste of time.
