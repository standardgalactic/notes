AI can never obtain:
Reflection
Desire
Emotion
Incentive
Overall purpose not defined at initial setting and subject to change
Wisdom
Humour
Common Sense
Reading the room (guaging the attitude of a social setting)
Art born from a desire to express internal conflicts or resolutions and communicate them
Curiosity
Morals
Discernment for the uncommon or unique cases
Feelings
Empathy
Connection or desire to relate
Desire to communicate successfully
...
It's.. a long list. 
None of these mentioned thus will ever be attainable by AI on its own. Because on its own presupposes an individuality exists. And in order to recognize ones individuality one must be able to self-reflect on some basic level and have it mean something real to them. 
Discernment is a divine quality in my book, I'm grateful to animals and machines for showing me the difference of when man creates and when God creates. And they are nothing alike.   Thank God.
