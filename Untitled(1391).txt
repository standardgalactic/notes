4.3 Knowledge and the quest for truth 
These last 15,000 years, the main vector of information that had 
been sensory perceptions, has become the language. Information 
we are receiving and memorizing now is verbal and is feeding 
the knowing line. However, most of it gets forgotten. 
Decay theory explains retrieval failure. Our memories fade 
because we have not assessed them for some time. We forget 
56% of information within an hour, 66% after a day, and 75%

after six days. We know we reinforce a brain connection by 
using it, and that we create a memory trace every time we 
memorize additional information. Savants prove that the brain’s 
capacity for memorizing is huge. Therefore, if we forget, there 
must be an evolutionary advantage. Psychologists believe the 
brain prunes memories that become unused, a process that is 
known as active forgetting. An old unused memory would 
“leave its place” to new information. 
What remains after some time are feelings and impressions from 
the natural world that we have attached to the verbal input. 
Pythagoras wanted to make sure that his students were 
motivated, he did not want them to register for the wrong 
reasons. He understood he should not limit the mental space to 
the verbal world. The purpose of Pythagoras’s meditation was to 
prepare the mental space to reorganize itself in order to register 
new concepts and sensory 
data.
