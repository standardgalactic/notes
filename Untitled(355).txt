1At the same tyme came the disciples vnto Iesus, and sayde: Who is the greatest in the kyngdome of heauen? 2And Iesus called a childe vnto him, and set him in the myddest amonge them,

3and sayde: Verely I saye vnto you: Excepte ye turne and become as children, ye shal not entre into the kyngdome of heauen. 4Whosoeuer therfore humbleth him self as this childe, ye same is the greatest in ye kyngdome of heauen. 5And who so receaueth soch a childe in my name, receaueth me.
