The scenario you're describing involves making bets with your friend in a way that, regardless of the lottery outcome, you would end up financially ahead. It's important to consider a few points:

1. **Risk**: While it might seem like a surefire way to win, there are inherent risks. If you lose the lottery, you'd owe your friend $1 million, which is a substantial amount.

2. **Ethical Considerations**: Such an arrangement might be viewed as unethical or manipulative, as it's essentially betting against yourself to ensure a financial gain. It could also strain your relationship with your friend.

3. **Legality**: Depending on where you live, there could be legal implications to such arrangements. Betting against yourself in a way that guarantees financial gain could potentially violate gambling or fraud laws.

4. **Practicality**: In reality, finding someone willing to make such a bet, especially for such large sums, would be highly unlikely.

It's important to approach any form of betting or financial arrangement with caution, considering both the ethical and legal implications. While the scenario you described may theoretically guarantee a financial gain, it's not a practical or advisable strategy due to the risks and potential consequences involved.
