What The Birds Are Tweeting

I'm designing an auditory operating system where each subject is given a tree assigned a bird that tweets its name.




And then I started talking to myself out loud and so decided to grab a quote.

It's an arbitrary system place to start an ecosystem.

I started talking out loud saying even though you'll be able to think with it, because that is part of what humans do, it's not a mind and it's not self-aware, and you can walk around in it like a memory palace.

And I looked around and I saw that I was surrounded by an eternal sacrifice of animals.

I said, killing animals is not a good place to start an ecosystem.

So the birds are saying, don't ban household cats, ban cars.

Ban paving parking lots,

And build eternal skyscrapers that reach 1,000 meters above sea level.

Birds don't know what they're talking about.

All they're doing is announcing their location

And their love interests.

There's already a Twitter going on and if our phones start listening to us all the time

This is what they'll hear, if we're still alive in the era of birds.

They're saying ban household cats or keep them contained.

They're saying allow Australia's ecosystem to infiltrate the world.

Build 1,000-foot skyscrapers into the air.

Can you hear it?

Anyways, that's all I got to say.
