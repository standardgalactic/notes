I haven't weighed in officially on generative AI for many reasons, including my understanding of the history of technology, AI generally, and how much generative AI as a transformative technology is not your mom's crypto or your granddad's internet boom.

Let's acknowledge that Pandora's Box will never be closed. It's done. That's how tech works and has for four million years. Let's also acknowledge that there are people who will find this transformative to their work and lives, and others who will be discarded in the race to productivity. And that there are practitioners with the best of intentions, and practitioners with the worst, who will use it to break any law they can and separate as many people from their money as possible.

The ramifications of Generative AI are exceedingly complex, mostly because there are both consequences we know will happen, because they've happened to other paradigm shifting technologies throughout history, and unintended consequences when the social changes are so fast and profound, no one has ever experienced them before, or thought the thoughts necessary to avoid bad outcomes. It will turn civilization upside down. Which side you end up on is not guaranteed.

It's easy to jump on one side of the debate or the other. I can come up with dozens of consequences--both intended and not--without thinking too hard. Therefore the most important thing we can all do is start a dialogue. Acknowledge it's not going away. Understand the conditions under which it was created and designed to serve. And work TOGETHER to come up with ways to ameliorate outcomes for as many as possible.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, but please be as considerate and respectful as possible. I have very intelligent and thoughtful friends, but you may not agree. In fact, I can guarantee it. ðŸ˜‰ Thank you.
