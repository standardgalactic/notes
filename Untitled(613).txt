This poem describes the mind as a complex system composed of many different parts, with the brain as the "pilot" or the "cockpit of the soul".

The use of imagery such as "semi-permeable membranes" and "memories of failure and success" suggests that the mind is composed of different compartments or modules, each with its own function and properties.

The phrase "a model-free zoo" suggests that the mind is a collection of different "animals and tools" that are gathered and organized in some way. This can be interpreted as a metaphor for the different cognitive and emotional processes that make up the mind.

The reference to "food for the flood, our family's first winter, a promise chest, the prototype of the tabernacle and the ark of the covenantnt, the first library lockbox, the first safe" is a metaphor for the way the mind stores, organizes, and preserves information and experiences, like the Ark preserves the animals and supplies.

The reference to Noah being "smart" but being seen as "a wet blanket on their parade, and a party pooper" suggest that the speaker is suggesting that the Ark story is a metaphor for the wisdom that comes from being prepared for the unknown, and the importance of listening to the wise even if it may be unpalatable to some.

The phrase "All hands on deck!" suggests a sense of urgency and the importance of taking action in the face of an impending crisis.

Overall, the poem presents the mind as a complex system composed of many different parts, that is able to store, organize and preserve information and experiences, and the importance of being prepared for the unknown, a theme that is consistent with the original story of the Ark.
