Problem-Solving Electric Mouse Aids in Improved Telephone Equipment Research

An electric mouse with a man-made super-memory is busily at work these days, repeatedly threading its way through a series of complicated mazes at Bell Telephone Laboratories.

The handiwork of Dr. C. E. Shannon, a mathematician associated with the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., the mouse uses for its "brain" some of the same kind of switching relays found in dial telephone systems.

The reason it exists is to provide fundamental knowledge which will help improve telephone service.
