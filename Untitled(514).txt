ComfyUI: Node-based UI comes to Stable Diffusion. 
Pretty interesting development from comfyanonymous, as he's released a fully node-based, modular UI for Stable Diffusion. I honestly don't totally understand the exact workflow being used yet and I'm just working with loading and modifying examples, but I can say with certainty that the Composition Area feature will be a game changer. This allows you to create two prompts with different aspect ratios (so you can generate your character in a square ratio and your background in 16:9 for example) that are then rendered together for a pretty seamless final image. Or have one part of an image be sunrise, one part afternoon, and another part night, etc.
