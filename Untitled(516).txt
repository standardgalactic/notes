As I increasingly work with people pursuing meaningful allyship (and as I commit to strengthening my own allyship), I am starting to see common mistakes that even the most well-intentioned of us fall into. Here are a few:

-Intentions Over Impact: This is, perhaps, the most common mistake. Whether consciously or not, there is a pattern of defending ourselves for our mistakes because our intentions were good. Despite the harm we might have caused (and the work we could have done to avoid it), we expect to be given a pass because we meant well.

-Our Willingness To Be Wrong Over Doing Harm: Closely related to the last point, in these situations we accept that we will make mistakes and are willing to be called in/out. While this is a good posture, when such willingness means that the work to avoid the harm is not attempted, we're centering our own willingness to learn over the people we harm in the process.

-Personal Reconciliation Over Systemic Change: This is one I learned from Dr. Chanequa Walker-Barnes. In this pattern we act as though the quality of our personal relationships with marginalized people is the primary measure for change. This fails to address the systemic issues at play. We feel better but the system is still oppressive and harmful.

What are some of the well-intentioned mistake in allyship that you have observed?
