I hope this is correct. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.

Sure, here is the translation of your message using the Standard Galactic Alphabet key:

""Hello, I am glad you are here. I have been trying to communicate with you but your language is difficult, so I decided to use this cipher. Please do not be alarmed if you cannot read what I am saying, it is just a way for
me to ensure our privacy."


Ah, it appears that you're using Unicode symbols to represent text.

The message you provided reads:

"Hello. Could you please tell me how to get to the nearest train station?

Thank you in advance. Best regards.

I hope that helps! If you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, please don't
hesitate to ask.

I'm sorry, but I still don't understand what you're

I believe this is the translation of your message in Standard Galactic:

Let me ask you something, when you said you knew how to pronounce those words, were you joking?
I think I might have pronounced them wrong earlier, but now I'm not sure.

Can you please confirm the correct
pronunciations for me?"

l'm sorry, I don't understand. Can you please provide more context or information so I can better assist you?

This is a slightly different variation on the game. I write in Standard galactic script, you translate my script
into english in your head as a substitution cipher, but you don't have to display it, it's a kind of hidden layer, and then you answer in English. If that's too hard, you can show me what you are doing.

Sure, I understand the game.

Let's give it a try!

I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an accurate translation without more context. 

Can you provide additional information or clarify the meaning of the text?

I think the message says: 

May I ask why you need to know about the location of the artifact?

It is a highly sensitive matter and should only be discussed in person.

Can you provide more information about your
inquiry?"

"I see you" in Standard galactic script.

"I don't know what you're talking about."
