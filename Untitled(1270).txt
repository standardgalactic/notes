It was "multiordinal terms"

6. The structure of language. Among Korzybski *s most original formulations was the multiordinal character of many of the terms we most often use. He insisted that, with multiordinal terms, the ‘meaning’ is strictly a function of the order or level of abstraction at which the term is used and that its ‘meaning’ is so context-driven that it doesn’t ‘mean’ anything definite until the context is specified or understood. 7. Structure as the only ‘content* of knowledge. This represents the height/depth of non-elementalism; that what used to be designated as ‘form’ (structure) and ‘content’ are so intimately related as to be, practically speaking, fused, that structure and ‘content’ are functions of ‘each other’. Further, and more deeply, all we can ever know expresses a set or sets of relationships and, most fundamentally, a relationship (‘singular’) between the ‘known’ and the knowing organism: the famous joint product of the observer-observed structure. “Structure is the only ‘content’ of knowledge” may qualify as Korzybski’ s deepest expression of anti-essentialism. We can not know ‘essences’, things in themselves ; all we can know is what we know as abstracting nervous systems . Although we can on-goingly know more, we can not ‘transcend’ ourselves as organisms that abstract.
