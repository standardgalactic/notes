— Tell me about Schrödinger's negentropy.

— Negentropy is a term used in information theory and statistics to measure the distance to normality. The concept and phrase "negative entropy" was introduced by Erwin Schrödinger in his 1944 popular-science book What is Life?¹. Later, Léon Brillouin shortened the phrase to negentropy¹². In his book, Schrödinger originally stated that life feeds on negative entropy, but in a later edition corrected himself in response to complaints and stated that the true source is free energy⁵. Schrödinger introduced the concept when explaining that a living system exports entropy in order to maintain its own entropy at a low level. By using the term "Negentropy", he could express this fact in a more "positive" way: A living system imports negentropy and stores it²³.
