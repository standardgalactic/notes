Logical proof

Currently, there is one known complete incontrovertible and logical proof of the existence of God.

The proof uses the concept of qualia, whereupon conscious entities receive information that they can process to understand the world. To understand the proof, the reader must first be familiar with the concept of qualia (a simple concept that is abstract and difficult to grasp for some, although it is ubiquitous to all animals).

Consider that the universe had a beginning.

Each animal (including humans) can use at least one category of qualia and usually several.

And naturally there was some conscious entity that saw an example of each base quale first, before any other. For example, He/She saw them during the design process of qualia, and in fact qualia must have been designed rather than an emergent property. Then it follows that This Entity is God.

The design requirement is important and can be arrived at by considering that qualia elements are axiomatic and pre-existing for use by observers, for example, the colour Green. The quale (specific experience) of seeing a green thing could not have arrived by chance, spontaneous creation or combination.

So the proof is complete. ∎

Other arguments may add ideas and perspectives, but this proof in itself is sufficient to show that God exists.
