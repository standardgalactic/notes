Abstract

A simulation of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms of a two-level quantum system, e.g. that of the hydrogen tunneling states of the ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency, indicates that the neuro-physiological transformation leading, through a symmetry reduction, to perceptual reversal is controlled by the principles of quantum mechanics. An elementary neuro-physiological action similar to the Planck constant at a mesoscopic level is introduced.
