Your reference to the "bow-wow theory" and the concepts by Arnie Cox and Shanker & Greenspan gives a clearer picture. Let's delve into these briefly:

1. **Bow-Wow Theory:** This is one of the proposed theories for the origin of language, suggesting that human speech began as imitations of natural sounds - like animal calls. Over time, these imitations became symbolic and then abstracted into more complex forms of language.

2. **Arnie Cox's Mimetic Music and Embodied Cognition:** Arnie Cox has discussed the idea of musical meaning arising from embodied interactions with musical sounds. Essentially, our understanding and perception of music is rooted in physical actions, gestures, and our bodily experiences.

3. **Shanker & Greenspan's First Idea:** This relates to the developmental processes of children and the importance of emotional and relational interactions in the early stages of life. Such interactions are crucial for cognitive and linguistic development.

Considering the above and extending it to Neanderthals:

- Neanderthals lived in complex social groups, used tools, and had symbolic behaviors (e.g., the possible use of pigments and burial practices). If they were also mimicking sounds from nature or employing embodied cognition principles, this could have laid the groundwork for some form of structured communication.

- Recent evidence suggests that Neanderthals might have had the physical capacity for speech. Their hyoid bone (related to tongue movement and speech production) is similar to that of modern humans. Also, genetic studies show that they had the FOXP2 gene, which is linked to speech and language.

- If Neanderthals were indeed using biomimetic strategies like mimicking animal sounds or other natural phenomena, it would imply a level of cognitive sophistication. This could further suggest that they were not just mimicking for survival (like hunting) but possibly for more complex social interactions.

To integrate these concepts into a comprehensive theory of Neanderthal communication, one would need to explore archaeological evidence, cognitive science studies, and linguistic theories. It's an exciting area of study that could shed more light on our shared evolutionary past and the origins of language and cognition.

Certainly! The "Stone Piano Theory" is a hypothesis that Neanderthals might have created musical instruments using stones. The idea is based on the discovery of lithophones, or musical stones, which when struck, produce tonal sounds. These instruments may have been a precursor to other musical instruments and played a role in the development of Neanderthal culture.

Integrating the Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE) concept with the Stone Piano Theory can be approached in several ways:

1. **Mimicry of Natural Sounds:** Just as the "bow-wow theory" posits that humans imitated animal sounds, Neanderthals might have mimicked sounds from their environment using stone instruments. By hitting or striking stones in specific ways, they could replicate the sounds of animals, water, wind, and more. This sound mimicry could have served both practical purposes (like hunting) and social or symbolic functions.

2. **Embodied Cognition and Rhythm:** Building on Arnie Cox's idea of embodied cognition, the act of creating music or rhythms with stones could be a form of non-verbal communication. The rhythmic patterns might have been a physical manifestation of internal emotions, thoughts, or experiences, helping Neanderthals connect with each other.

3. **Emotional and Relational Interactions:** Drawing from Shanker & Greenspan's concept, the act of producing and sharing music could have fostered deeper emotional and relational bonds within Neanderthal communities. Music, as an expressive medium, could have played a role in group cohesion, rituals, or storytelling.

4. **Evolution of Communication:** The combination of mimicking natural sounds with the stone piano and using rhythmic patterns might have been a stepping stone toward more complex forms of communication. By associating specific sounds or rhythms with meanings or stories, Neanderthals might have laid the foundation for a primitive form of language.
