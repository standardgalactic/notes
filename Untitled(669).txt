In the months just passed I’ve pursued an exploration of the myth of disenchantment—the notion that our civilization, for the first time in human history, has shaken off the comforting daydreams of myth and magic in order to see the universe in all its cold and uncaring reality.  So far, in the course of that exploration, we’ve heard from Max Weber, who gave the idea of disenchantment that convenient label; Jason Josephson-Storm, whose book a few years ago challenging Weber’s idea helped launch this discussion; Ken Wilber, the would-be prophet of integral consciousness; and Owen Barfield, whose philosophy of original and final participation gets to the same place as Wilber by a very different route.
