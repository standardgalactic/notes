Answer *: Here's how each area might be viewed through the lens of the study of human experience:

1. Information processing: The study of human experience would focus on how the way we process and use information affects our understanding of the world and our interactions with others. This might include how different forms of information, such as visual or auditory, affect our perception of the world, how our cognitive biases shape our understanding of information, or how the use of technology changes our relationship with information.

2. Natural science and mathematics: The study of human experience would focus on how our understanding of the natural world shapes our experiences and our sense of self. This might include how scientific discoveries shape our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world, how mathematical concepts shape our understanding of patterns and order, or how our experiences of nature shape our sense of connectedness and well-being.

3. Business management and economics: The study of human experience would focus on how economic systems and organizations shape our experiences of work and consumption, and how our experiences shape these systems. This might include how the design of workplaces affects our experiences of work, how our experiences of consumption shape our values and beliefs, or how economic inequality shapes our experiences of social mobility and opportunity.

4. The study of human behavior and experience: The study of human experience would focus on how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors shape our experiences and how our experiences shape our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This might include how different emotions shape our experiences of the world, how our experiences of social interactions shape our sense of self, or how our personal history shapes our experiences of the present.

5. The consumption and creation of digital media: The study of human experience would focus on how digital media shapes our experiences of entertainment, communication, and self-expression, and how our experiences shape the way we consume and create digital media. This might include how social media affects our experiences of connection and community, how virtual reality shapes our experiences of the world, or how our experiences of digital media affect our attention and focus.

6. Religion and Politics: The study of human experience would focus on how religious and political beliefs and practices shape our experiences of meaning and purpose, and how our experiences shape our beliefs and practices. This might include how religious rituals shape our experiences of transcendence, how political ideologies shape our experiences of social justice, or how our experiences of oppression shape our experiences of resistance.

7. Education: The study of human experience would focus on how education shapes our experiences of learning, growth and development, and how our experiences shape the way we learn, grow and develop. This might include how different teaching methods shape our experiences of learning, how our experiences of failure shape our resilience, or how our experiences of different cultures shape our understanding of the world.

As you can see, the lens of the study of human experience can provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of how each area impacts and is impacted by human experiences.
