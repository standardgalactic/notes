further, but it's clear that he was exploring concepts that were centuries ahead of his time," says Gharib. "And his approach was quite innovativeâ€”he didn't just rely on abstract mathematics, but he was also using experiments to try to understand how things worked."

The study highlights the importance of revisiting historical scientific works to gain new insights and appreciation for the work of past scientists and engineers. It also underscores the fact that scientific progress is often made through a collaborative effort, with researchers building upon the ideas and discoveries of those who came before them.
