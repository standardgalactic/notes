Once upon a time, in a small village there lived a man named Akhfash who owned a goat that could nod its head in response to questions.

The villagers were amazed by this goat and believed it had supernatural powers. Akhfash, being a clever man, realized he could use this to his advantage and began to perform tricks with the goat for the villagers.

One day, a group of young villagers came to watch the show. They were skeptical of Akhfash's claims and were determined to figure out the truth behind the goat's nodding abilities.

Akhfash began his performance by calling out the names and birthdays of the villagers. He would ask yes or no questions and raise his voice when he wanted the goat to nod its head.

The young villagers noticed that every time Akhfash let out a yelp, the goat would nod wildly.

"I think Akhfash is using some kind of signal to make the goat nod," one of the young villagers whispered to the others.

"But how could he be doing that?" another asked.

Just then, Akhfash stumbled and stubbed his toe. He let out a yelp, and the goat began nodding wildly once again. The young villagers burst out laughing as they finally realized the truth behind the goat's nodding abilities.

"Akhfash is just using his yelps to make the goat nod!" one of the young villagers exclaimed.

The group of young villagers tried to tell the other villagers about Akhfash's trickery, but no one believed them. It wasn't until one day, when something went wrong during one of Akhfash's shows, that the truth was finally exposed.

During a show, Akhfash was holding a table with the names and birthdays of all the villagers written on it. He accidentally dropped the table and the villagers saw that he was using it to trick them into thinking the goat had supernatural powers.

"It's all a trick!" the young villagers shouted.

The villagers were shocked and could not believe they had been fooled for so long. From that day on, the truth about Akhfash and his goat was known throughout the village, and they were no longer held in high esteem.

The moral of the story is that one should always be cautious of those who make false claims and try to deceive others for their own gain.
