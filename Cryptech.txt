I Discovered a Huge Problem We Face in Africa - How Can We Help To Solve This?🧠💡

On this day, I decided to plan my day with google tasks so I can see how productive I would become. I listed out everything I was going to do and set the appropriate time for each task.⏲️

My mind was already prepared for the next day after planning the night before. I was very determined when I got out of bed, I did all my chores so I won't have my mom disrupt me while working👩‍💻. On getting to reach for my laptop, I discovered there was no power supply, I believed it was the usual “taking and bringing of electricity” but that wasn’t the case.

I waited the whole day, and there was no power supply this got me really sad to the point I was very distressed (Can not count the number of times this has happened) but, it really hit me so hard even to the point of tears because I hate wasting time and I had a lot to be done.🥺

This happened the next day and sadly, even all week. I was really pained and my productivity rate dropped.

I feel even more pain for those who had/have to go through this for weeks or months, this is really bad if you ask me, especially for us programmers.😞

How do we change this, developers?
What if an AI can be built to solve the issue of electricity in Africa? Let me know your opinion(s).🤔
