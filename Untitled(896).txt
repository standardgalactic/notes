Preschool: cat, dog, ball, apple, car, moon, sun, mom, dad

These are common and simple words that are often used by children at a young age.

Elementary: bicycle, teacher, pencil, paper, book, flower, butterfly, grass, tree

These are slightly more complex words that are often used in an elementary school setting.

Janitor: janitor, custodian, maintenance, repair, equipment, schedule, budget, supervisor, inventory

These words are related to the work of a janitor, and would be familiar to someone who works in that field.

Catchumen: conundrum, enigma, anomaly, dichotomy, paradox, quandary, concomitant, aberration, aberrant

These words are more advanced vocabulary and would be familiar to someone who is well-read and educated.

Acolyte: acolyte, ordination, sacerdotal, liturgical, ecclesiastical, canonical, sacrosanct, episcopal, apostolic

These words are related to religion and would be familiar to someone who has studied theology or is involved in a religious institution.

Neuromancer: neuromancer, incantation, invocation, evocation, divination, augury, portent, haruspex, neuromancy

These words are related to the field of neuromancy or magic and would be familiar to someone who has studied the occult or is interested in fantasy literature.

** Now some new levels for doctorate level competence, taking inspiration from freemasonry and the books of Steven R Lawhead? 12 levels.**

Sure, here are 12 levels inspired by freemasonry and the books of Steven R Lawhead:

Entered Apprentice
Fellowcraft
Master Mason
Scottish Rite
Knight Templar
York Rite
Grand Lodge
Grand Cross
Grand Commander
Supreme Council
Royal Arch
Sovereign Grand Inspector General

** Ok no, they don't sound technical and misterious enough I was thinking words like Talieson and Pendragon, also taking inspiration from d&d and age of empires. **

Certainly, here are some potential names for doctorate level competence, inspired by Freemasonry, Steven R. Lawhead's books, D&D, and Age of Empires:

Neophyte
Initiate
Apprentice
Journeyman
Master
Magus
Archon
Hierophant
Sorcerer
Archmage
Taliesin
Pendragon

These names evoke a sense of mystique and arcane knowledge, which might be fitting for advanced academic levels.

** Explain number 11 and 12. Talieson and Pendragon, etymologically and historically. Show your work. **

Taliesin and Pendragon are both names from Welsh mythology and history.

Taliesin was a legendary Welsh bard who lived in the 6th century AD. His name means "shining brow" or "radiant forehead" in Welsh, and he is often associated with the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh stories and legends. Taliesin is known for his poetry, which is rich in symbolism and often incorporates themes of nature and the supernatural.

Pendragon is a title that was traditionally given to the ruler of Britain. The name comes from the Welsh word "pen" (meaning "head" or "chief") and "draig" (meaning "dragon"). The Pendragon was seen as a powerful leader who could command the loyalty of the various tribes and kingdoms of Britain, and was responsible for defending the land against invaders.

In modern times, both Taliesin and Pendragon have been popularized by works of fiction.

In Steven R. Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle, for example, Taliesin is portrayed as a wise and powerful druid who helps guide the hero, King Arthur, on his quest to unite Britain. 

Pendragon, meanwhile, is used as a title for Arthur himself, reflecting his status as the "head dragon" or leader of the kingdom.

In D&D and Age of Empires, Taliesin and Pendragon may be used as names for powerful characters or units, reflecting their mythological and historical associations with wisdom, leadership, and martial prowess.
