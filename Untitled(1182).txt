Both qualitative and quantitative methods are employed. From the perspective of technological innovation, using scientometric methods, 105 pieces of classic texts from the 1930s–2010s are extracted from the references of 3862 pieces of high-quality literature from the 1900s–2020s. As a result, based on a combination of qualitative data analysis and topic model analysis, we developed a typology with eight meta-theories of technological innovation, including performance-based, resource-based, knowledge-based, capability-based, network-based, technological-innovation-system, dual-innovation, and dynamic-sustainability views.  

Then we analyzed 1) the evolution, reification, and confusion relationships between different meta-theories; 2) the causes of technological innovation's concept jungle; and 3) an integrated framework of technological innovation meta-theories. This study analyzed the benefits of the meta-theoretical analysis on the future study of technological innovation. Additionally, the results of this study can help to measure technological innovation, construct new theories, and improve the efficiency of the connection between the practical problems of innovation and potentially useful theoretical frameworks.
