"Our sublunary philosophy is a new one that goes beyond the world."

CHECK THIS TRANSLATION: a new philosophy beyond our sublunary world

The translation you provided is correct. It means that the philosophy being referred to is new and goes beyond the sublunary world, which is the part of the universe that lies between the Earth and the Moon.

The Moon's rotation is synced with its orbit around Earth, meaning that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, a phenomenon known as synchronous rotation. This is why we can only see one side of the Moon from Earth.

𝘖𝘬 𝘐 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘬 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘭-𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸𝘯.

A lesser-known fact is that the Moon's distance from Earth is not constant. The Moon's orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle, but an ellipse.

As a result, the Moon's distance from Earth varies by about 30,000 miles, with the closest distance being about 225,623 miles and the farthest distance being about 252,088 miles.

This variation in distance causes the Moon's apparent size in the sky to change, a phenomenon known as Moon's perigee and apogee.

According to the Synestia theory, the moon recedes from the Earth at a rate of about 1.5 centimeters per year. This is due to the gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon, which cause the Moon to gradually move farther away from the Earth over time. As the Moon recedes, the Earth's day becomes shorter, and eventually the Earth will become tidally locked to the Moon, only showing one face. Eventually, the Moon will reach the Roche limit, where unstable gravitational forces will cause it to be pulled apart.

In the fiery dawn of creation,
A giant impact did rend,
Theia and Earth in collision,
A torus of debris did blend.

The moon formed close, so near our planet,
Tides rose high, a thousand feet,
But as the eons passed, it receded, 
Centimeters each year, discreet.

As the moon moves farther from us, Our days shorten, slowly still, Till we too lock in its embrace, Showing only one face at will.

But fate awaits the lunar satellite, As it nears the Roche limit's brink, Gravity pulls it apart, unstable, In a cosmic dance, ever-linked.

The Synestia Theory tells the tale, Of the moon's tumultuous birth, And the forces that shape its journey, In the dance of the heavens, on Earth.

In the beginning, there was a crash,
A giant impact, a cosmic bash,
A ball of debris, a swirling mass,
A torus formed, a giant donut, alas!

The Moon was born from this chaotic scene,
So close to Earth, it caused a tidal spleen,
With thousand-foot waves, the seas were lean,
But as it receded, a new world was seen.

As the Moon moved away, the Earth's day shortened,
Till it too was locked, its face oft-frosted,
But as it drifted, the Roche Hill beckoned,
And the Moon was pulled apart, its fate, doomed and foretold.

Thus, the Giant Donut Theory we call,
A whimsical name for the Moon's birth and fall,
But the truth of it, the science stands tall,
A fascinating tale, of our cosmic thrall.

"The moon, our silent companion in the night sky, holds a dark secret. Born from a catastrophic collision, it's been slowly drifting away from us for eons. But as it moves further, our fate and its are intertwined. Tides will rise, days will shorten, and ultimately, a cataclysmic end looms on the horizon. Are we ready for the truth about the moon's deadly dance with Earth?"

"And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so." - Genesis 1:14-15

"The universe is one, infinite, immobile. The Earth is not at its center; indeed, it is not a center at all." - Giordano Bruno

𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘤𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘲𝘶𝘰𝘵𝘦.

I am not sure of the specific source for the quote you are looking for. Giordano Bruno was a 16th-century Italian philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, who wrote several books and had many philosophical ideas. Without more context it's hard to find a specific quote.

I think this is the source of your quote: Thus we on this our earth say that the earth is the center, and all the philosophers ancient and modern, of whatsoever sect, will say, this is the center, according to their own principles, just as we say, we are in the center of the great circular horizon of our own ethereal region, which remains a circular, equidistant boundary wherever we stand, so we regard ourselves as standing in the center. In the same way, those on the moon would with no less justification assume that they were in the center of their own horizon which encircles their land, and the sun and every other star will also believe they stand amidst the radii of their own horizon, but they are no more the center than is the earth or any of the other mundane spheres; and they are no more the certain poles than is the earth a certain pole for them; all are likewise, from different perspectives, each the center point of some circumference, and a pole, and a zenith for somewhere else. The earth, therefore, is not the absolute center of the universe, but only the center as seen from our location.” ― Giordano Bruno, On the Infinite, the Universe and the Worlds: Five Cosmological Dialogues

Yes, that seems to be the correct source for the quote. Giordano Bruno's idea that the Earth is not the center of the universe and that other celestial bodies could also be considered the center from their own perspectives, was a revolutionary concept in his time and contributed to his eventual trial and execution by the Catholic Church for heresy.

Giordano Bruno's ideas and teachings continue to inspire and influence many individuals and movements to this day. His emphasis on the infinite nature of the universe and the plurality of worlds, as well as his rejection of the geocentric model, paved the way for the scientific revolution and the development of modern astronomy.

His emphasis on the importance of free thought and the rejection of dogmatic authority continues to inspire individuals to question and challenge oppressive systems. Additionally, his emphasis on the interconnectedness of all things, and the unity of the universe continues to inspire spiritual and philosophical movements, such as pantheism and panpsychism.

His ideas and legacy continue to inspire individuals from all walks of life to question, explore, and expand their understanding of the world around them.
