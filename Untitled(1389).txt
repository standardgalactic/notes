My Weird Science students are skeptical about conspiracy theories, but it all seems somewhat superficial. They're wary of conspiracy theories largely because their education and their rather unexceptional media diet has conditioned them to think there is something wrong with anything labeled a "conspiracy theory." But they have a hard time articulating what exactly is wrong beyond reflecting the sense of disapproval they've learned that an educated person is supposed to express.

I wonder, then, if the superficial, media-zombie way we seem to inculcate skepticism has a potential to backfire in some cases. After all, I expect that many people eventually discover that especially politically-motivated lies amplified by media are quite common. And then, conspiracy theories provide an easy, superficial way of making sense of the sea of lies we swim in.
