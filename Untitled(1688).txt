The Paradox of the Prophets

If the doomsday prophets were to buy coffee from the store without discount coupons so that they could maximize the benefit of shelf-surfing in the middle of a large and dirty parking lot full of cars with the same number on their license plates even though the car owners were the same as the amount of flour listed in their mother's Karelian pie recipe without the final number ending in the third-largest length that people can perceive just by looking at the sky without a magnifying glass that doesn't have a tube to assist in collecting light into a cup so that it could be served later when climate-anxious people park next to their car's rear tires in a way that the inner tires are removed by slowly releasing a blue compound and waiting for the band to park next to them and pull the car away without additional charges due to the climate change caused by watching the suns through a magnifying glass without a tube in the middle of a café that was inside the store next to the parking lot from which you could see the same license plates of cars without any reflection from the dusty café window that also went through the store window using the theory of relativity that allows light to move faster in the glass whose bottom has been broken into small crumbs to clean the door lock so that opening the door wouldn't cause new compounds with the crushed stones because it would result in all the world's record companies becoming increasingly blue since environmental cleanliness begins to produce blue algae through sunlight on the other side of the sandy beach without boaters being able to paddle with their self-standing device using the circular shape preventing the boat from tipping over through the water without friction against the sandy beach to create a new trace that can be used to deduce parking lot numbers one by one because the round ball prevents errors due to its perfectly curved surface even though its color is as deep as the artificial lake created in the Himalayan desert on the world's highest mountain without a single change except when the doomsday prophets survive their own mental marshmallows that they usually try to burn without a gas flame outdoors in the middle of the forest even though there is a dangerous forest fire warning in effect, which was actually caused by spruce trees even though they don't even have any rear tires to make a report through the fire station window while the doomsday prophets sit in the sandpit in the middle of the forest's tallest peak and burn large pieces of the brownest and heaviest sand possible, which has been dug from the lake to alleviate hunger, in order to produce much cleaner energy for the sandboxes in the middle of the forest where adults can play away from prying eyes while they eat the long-matured announcement obtained from the fire station that the pine had previously made because it lacked a rear tire from its own selection on the store shelf even though there should always be at least one rear tire on the shelf at this time of year because Finnish law is too protective of us citizens with notifications about forest fire warnings, as using a telescope has always been mandatory at night when you can no longer buy coffee from the store without a dust bag that you would like to use with a vacuum cleaner during the autumn clean-up while others grill compounds outside the sausages using gas, which cannot be ignited due to the forest fire warning unless there is at least one fire chief present whose boat broke down in last year's marathon, leaving only the shoeprints on the asphalt that were made in that place the night before using a blue compound in a deal made with record companies and the terms dictated by the doomsday prophets, which they came up with by buying coffee when one of them dropped a discount coupon on the ground that opened the hatch from which fresh water poured in from the boater's back room, which the doomsday prophets had previously dyed completely dark brown as a wave pattern in their childhood, which you always see when you go boating in the middle of the windy saltwater that people put in their mouths just for fun, as all other substances were prohibited due to previously agreed rules, which has usually been very burdensome, especially for men who eat grilled sausages with a gas grill while fearing that the waters will become saltier due to emissions caused by them, every day within the original factories of completely clean underwear in the heat without oxygen masks or additional water day after day with a very low wage that just covers the cost of making a coffee at home without having to leave home even once during the day because the door lock had been cleaned with a sand compound, and it can always be opened perfectly as long as you wait for the climate to stop getting hotter due to the thoughts of the forecasters wearing tin foil hats while making baked potatoes and burning grass outside next to the sandbox by being silent until the tin foil hat can open a new path from the lake next to the perfect self-confidence of the surface found by not taking into account the fact that the speed of light is greater in glass than in water unless that water is actually completely blue, which climate change has usually produced in pure water with no fish living in it due to overfishing caused by a hot summer that led to excessive willow growth, from which everyone had made at least one problematic tool for schoolwork so that the teacher wouldn't be sad about a perfect grade on the history test that everyone else had received the lowest scores on, which were also found in the trunks of pine trees without any magnifying glass, even though having the best possible vision would have been the best solution in this case given the final number in the test, which was six million people in the future or the present, depending on when the excessive fishing for overgrown willow branches in completely pure water and outside it is done at the same time, talking about the test that the teacher had given us in the middle of the forest where we played in the sandbox even though there should only have been adults whose shoe size exceeds sixteen or even larger, as the number of pine trees completely devoid of wifi to limit their social media use and talk about life's larger matters in the online park, listening to the sounds of leaves without using wifi, only using their mouths and making the right facial expressions to get their messages across with as little radioactive blue color produced by uranium as possible, which people want to use for social media and walking quietly in the middle of the crunchy sand forest without leaving any footprints that would stick to the freshly painted surface of the asphalt forming a compound word that social media users usually want to use when they discuss life's bigger matters in the online park, even though it was extremely cold outside at the same time when others slid down the water park stairs backwards without ever coming out of the other end of the tube, laughing about how round the inside of the tube actually was and why it smelled exactly the same as the energy that comes into cellphone screens from blue uranium, which is also used to pump water into every corner of the water park while people eat ice cream inside the pool even though there is only water and no air to heat up the melting ice cream with the greenhouse effect, which was the doomsday prediction made with magnifying glasses without tubes even though there wasn't a single period in the entire sentence that determined the future of humanity's ice cream consumption at the water park's ice cream eating championship.
