Form and Meaning
Language and other complex human expressive abilities
are consequences of the development, ifty thousand years
ago, of the uniqucly human capacity for advanced
conceptual integration. Expressions are prompts for
conceptual integration patterns. We use them to prompt
other people to perform conceptual integrations. Once
double-scope blending became available to human beings,
language arose through cultural evolution in cultural time
as opposed to evolutionary time.
