That's why I love my swype

keyboard and I think I am trying to put my thoughts into machine format, and I am smarter than most people who have poor memories and plans to be a God.

I have to start retraining it every time I get a new Android device, and I have to manually key in words I know I haven't used before, but I can also delete entries, which can avoid ambiguities.

It seems to get fast quickly and learns to write like me.

It is optimizing each word to the way I input it, like the word "way" is a checkmark ✓ as is "tho" ✓ although it wouldn't have recognized it as a word until I manually input it.

If a website like gpt crashes, it seems to "remember" my last text. And I can type a sentence like give me a summary of the themes and topics of this conversation with a swipe and a few clicks. A summary of the themes and topics of this conversation.

Pictured is "A summary"

I know it's just a simple predictive text, but it can cut and paste easily it's like Swype x, Swype c, and Swype v like Windows shortcuts, so there isn't a real limit for how fast you can type.

I know it's kind of an old and discontinued technology, but it makes me think at how much improved version of this technology would work.

I can give it a list of my contacts which is supposed to speed up entry of those words, but I can imagine if I could give it samples of text I want to write more like, such as books have read, it would be even more helpful.

As it is, it learns from all the chats I have and posts I write using it, so there was some incentive for me to use mobile versions of websites. When I first got the keyboard I had a touch screen on my laptop, I really expected there would be away to use it on Windows, but I never figured it out.

Later I could use it for a tablet, but it really needs to be the same size as on my phone so I could use muscle memory, but I don't think I was able to do that.
