UNDERSTANDING 
THE BRAIN 
This leads to a fundamental 
point about any attempt to unders - 
tand the brain. It is a particularly 
acute case of the problems encounte - 
red in understanding anything. The 
nature of the attention one brings to 
bear on anything alters what one 
finds; what we aim to understand 
changes its nature with the context in 
which it lies; and we can only ever 
understand anything as a something.

There is no way round these 
problems 
– if they are problems. To 
attempt to detach oneself entirely is 
just to bring a special kind of attenti- 
on to bear which will have important 
consequences for what we find. Simi - 
larly we cannot see something without 
there being a context, even if the 
context appears to be that of ‘no 
context’, a thing ripped free of its 
moorings in the lived world. That is 
just a special, highly value-laden kind 
of context in itself, and it certainly al- 
ters what we find, too. Nor can we 
say that we do not see things as 
anything at all 
– that we just see 
them, full stop. There is always a 
model by which we are understan - 
ding, an exemplar with which we are 
comparing, what we see, and where it 
is not identified it usually means that 
we have tacitly adopted the model of 
the machine. 
Does that mean that all at- 
tempts to approach truth 
– other 
than to say everything has its truth in 
its own way 
– are doomed, that eve- 
ry version of reality has equal value? 
Certainly not. I will explore these is- 
sues later, as they are central to this 
book. That needs to wait until we 
have had a look at what the hemispheres actually ‘do’. 
Such considerations apply to 
the attempt to understand anything at 
all. But when we come to look at 
what we refer to as brain functions, 
there is a problem of a wholly diffe - 
rent order. We are not ‘just’ looking 
at things in the world 
– a lump of 
rock, or even a person 
– but the 
processes whereby the world itself, to- 
gether with the rock or the person, 
might be brought into being for us at 
all, the very foundations of the fact of 
our experience, including any idea we 
might have about the nature of the 
world, and the nature of the brain, 
and even the idea that this is so. If it 
is true that attention changes the na - 
ture of what we find, how do we de - 
cide the most appropriate attention for 
that ? One that tries to ignore the in- 
wardness of experience? What pos - 
sible context is there in which to pla - 
ce the foundations of experience of all
contexts whatever? And what kind of 
a thing are we to see it ‘as’? The an- 
swer is far from obvious, but in the 
absence of an attempt to address the 
question we do not give no answer. 
We answer with the model we under - 
stand 
– the only kind of thing we 
can ever fully understand, for the 
simple reason that we made it: the 
machine. We cannot look at the world 
coming into being within the brain, 
without that qualifying the world in 
which the brain itself exists; our un - 
derstanding of the brain’s ways of un - 
derstanding alters our understanding 
of the brain itself 
– the process is 
not unidirectional, but reciprocal. If it 
turns out that the hemispheres have 
different ways of construing the world, 
this is not just an interesting fact abo - 
ut an efficient information-processing 
system; it tells us something about 
the nature of reality, about the nature 
of our experience of the world, and 
needs to be allowed to qualify our 
understanding of the brain as well.
