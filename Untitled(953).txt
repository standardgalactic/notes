Lifetime of the universe: You could research different theories and models of the universe's lifetime, and explore how Ising models and other simulation techniques are being used to study the evolution of the universe over time. You could also investigate the latest astronomical observations and measurements, and consider how they are informing our understanding of the universe's ultimate fate.
