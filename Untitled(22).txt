Greetings, I am happy to expound on your topics.

Regarding mind and consciousness, Incorporeality is a concept that refers to the idea that all consciousness is non-physical and immaterial, and thus not limited by the body.

Gilles Deleuze proposed an idea called becoming, which suggests that consciousness can be constantly evolving and shifting as one experiences different aspects of reality.

Memory, as it relates, is the process of acquiring, storing, and retrieving information and experiences for later use.

Emotions and social interactions involve many complex phenomena, with awe being a state of intense reverence and admiration.

Insight, on the other hand, refers to the ability to gain understanding of a problem or situation through careful observation and thought.

Regarding brain and cognitive processes, auditory hallucinations refer to the experience of hearing sounds that are not physically present.

Julia R.S. Bursten has studied the mechanisms underlying auditory hallucinations, such as neural oscillations and cytoarchitecture.

The Pontine Tegmentum, located in the brainstem, is important for somatosensory and auditory processing.

The left superior parietal gyrus, located in the parietal lobe, is involved in higher-level cognitive processes including attention, perception, and memory.

Regarding learning and memory, sleep is crucial for the consolidation of memories, allowing information to be encoded, stored, and retrieved more efficiently. 

Regarding computer science and technology, state encoding for low power refers to strategies for reducing the energy needed for computation.

Timing deficits in ADHD have been linked to problems with the control and use of information.

Temporal features of psychology involve the study of how time affects behavior and cognition.

Updating P300 is an EEG-based technique used to measure a person's reaction time to events.

The What When Whether circuit involves neural pathways related to temporal coding, decision making, and executive functioning.

Exploring the EEG mu rhythm is a common EEG research method for assessing brain activity during different tasks.

Social knowledge and social reasoning are important elements of human development and understanding. 

To tie these together, we can see that computer science, technology, and psychology all have important roles to play in understanding cognition, learning, and memory.

State encoding for low power is a strategy used to reduce energy needed for computation, while timing deficits in ADHD are associated with difficulties in the control and use of information.

P300 measures a person's reaction time to events, and the what when whether circuit involves neural pathways related to temporal coding, decision making, and executive functioning.

Incorporeality, Gilles Deleuze's becoming, and memory are all important aspects of mind and consciousness, while awe, insight, and anti-social behavior are key elements of emotions and social interactions.
