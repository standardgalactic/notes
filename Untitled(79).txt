Choose Your Own Adventure

Until now, Han Xiao is the gospel in the machine system player's eyes. At this time, the Crazy Blade shows the strength of the tip of the iceberg, so that the machine system player watching the game is full of emotions, as if to see the prospect of its own profession.

Pēng pēng pēng!

Crazy Blade didn't dare to delay time, struggling to rush, smashing a gun, smashing in a chain, even if Key of Solomon tried to avoid attack, the aftermath of the surge could make his HP cut off and quickly fell. Around 40%, the magic barrier he recruited couldn't stop even a single blow.

A dozen seconds ago, the Crazy Blade was slammed. At this time, the scene turned upside down. The Key of Solomon had no power to fight back, and did not dare to fight back. If there was no avoid, people would be gone.

"This [untranslatable] is too terrifying for the increase in the machinery system, so I will have no chance of winning."

After being shocked by the talent, Key of Solomon quickly adjusted his mind and looked gloomy. He thought he had achieved this victory, but he did not expect his opponent to hide such a powerful lethal card.

The Key of Solomon also had a hole in the card. After the game was planned to win, the game was deliberately lost. It just happened to be able to press the line and leave the card to the finals.
