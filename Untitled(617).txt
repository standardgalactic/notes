Male nipples are not atavisms, but rather serve no purpose in the organism and are therefore not selected for by evolutionary forces.

They are thought to be the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, which can explain why both men and women have nipples, as it is most likely an ancestral trait before modern sex-specific differences evolved.

Recurrent protopathy is a developmental process characterized by the duplication and embedding of tissue with little useful function.

It occurs in embryonic development and is thought to be responsible for male nipples, as well as other non-functional anatomical features such as tailbone and wisdom teeth.

While male nipples may play a role in providing nutrients for the pectoral muscles, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that they are involved in the deposition of building materials for muscle, skin, and other cells. (My pet theory)

Male nipples are thought to be primarily the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, where tissue is duplicated and embedded with little useful function.

This duplication can lead to the development of dissipative structures, such as male nipples, as these structures are not selected for by evolutionary forces.
