virtual storage Descriptive of the capabil-
ity to use online secondary storage devices
and specialized software to divide programs
into smaller segments for transmission to and
from internal storage in order to significantly
increase the effective size of the available
internal storage
visual display terminal A device capable
of displaying keyed input and CPU output on
a cathode ray tube

VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) The
packing of hundreds of thousands of elec-
tronic components on a single semiconductor
chip
voice-grade channels Medium-speed data
transmission channels that use telephone
communications facilities.
volatile storage A storage medium that
loses its contents in the event of a power in-
terruption.
von Neumann bottleneck A reference to
the fact that processing speed in a von Neu-
mann machine is limited by the speed of (1)
the circuits in the single channel used to
carry instructions from primary storage to
the control section, and (2) the circuits in the
single data path between primary storage and
the arithmetic-logic section.
von Neumann machine A computer sys-
tem whose CPU has a single control, pri-
mary storage, and arithmetic-logic section.
Such a machine follows the design approach
developed by John von Neumann and others
in the mid-1940s.
