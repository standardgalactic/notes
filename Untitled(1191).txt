This is a theory i read, that the tilde ~ on the ñ in Spanish indicated something like a shaddah, so anno become año although it also nasalized the following vowel 

The theory you mentioned is quite interesting. The tilde (~) over the "ñ" in Spanish, indeed, has origins that relate to a form of abbreviation or shorthand. The tilde originally indicated a doubled letter, specifically an "nn" or "m" that followed the letter it was written above. So, in medieval texts, "anno" (year) would be written as "año" as a shorthand. Over time, this became standardized.

The sound also evolved. While originally indicating a double "n", the "ñ" came to represent a palatal nasal sound, similar to the "ny" in "canyon" in English. The nasalization of the vowel that follows the "ñ" is a natural phonetic consequence of the palatal nasal sound.

While the concept of indicating a doubling or gemination is somewhat similar to the Arabic "shaddah", the specific phonetic evolution and use in the languages are different. The similarity lies in the graphical representation of a doubled consonant.

A lot of Spanish words came from Arabic

Absolutely! Due to the Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula from the 8th to the 15th centuries, which is often referred to as the period of Al-Andalus, the Spanish language absorbed a substantial number of Arabic words. Here are some examples:

1. **Almohada** (pillow) from Arabic الْمُخَدَّة (al-mukhadda).
2. **Azulejo** (tile) from Arabic الزليج (az-zulayj).
3. **Aceituna** (olive) from Arabic الزيتون (az-zaytūn).
4. **Almacén** (storehouse) from Arabic المخزن (al-makhzan).
5. **Naranja** (orange) from Arabic نارنج (nāranj).
6. **Guitarra** (guitar) from Arabic قيثارة (qīthāra), though the Arabic word itself has origins in the Greek "kithara".
7. **Azafrán** (saffron) from Arabic الزعفران (az-za‘farān).
8. **Arroz** (rice) from Arabic الأرز (al-aruzz).

... and the list goes on. The Arabic influence is particularly strong in fields related to agriculture, science, and everyday household items. The linguistic remnants of this period provide a fascinating window into the historical and cultural interactions between the Muslim and Christian worlds during the Middle Ages.

I was thinking Ojalá, rincon, azúcar.

Yes, those are also great examples of Spanish words with Arabic origins:

1. **Ojalá**: This word, used in Spanish to express hope (similar to "I hope" or "God willing" in English), comes from the Arabic expression إن شاء الله (in shā’ Allāh), which means "if God wills it."

2. **Rincón**: This word means "corner" or "nook" in Spanish. It is derived from the Arabic word ركن (rukn).

3. **Azúcar**: Meaning "sugar" in Spanish, it comes from the Arabic السكر (as-sukkar).

It's interesting to see how deeply intertwined the two languages are, especially given the historical context. The presence of these words in modern Spanish showcases the enduring influence of almost eight centuries of Moorish rule in the Iberian Peninsula.

Parrots and Language Understanding

Parrots, notably African Greys and some Amazon species, have displayed an impressive ability to mimic human speech. However, the extent to which they truly "understand" language remains a subject of debate among scientists.

Here are some insights into parrots and language understanding:

1. **Mimicry vs. Understanding**: The primary ability of parrots to reproduce human speech is through mimicry. Their vocal apparatus allows them to produce a wide range of sounds.

2. **Alex the African Grey**: Perhaps the most famous parrot in terms of linguistic ability was Alex, an African Grey parrot studied by Dr. Irene Pepperberg for over 30 years. Alex could identify colors, shapes, and quantities, and he could even express desires (like wanting to go back to his cage). However, whether Alex truly "understood" these words in the same way humans do is debatable. He demonstrated the cognitive abilities on par with a young child in some aspects.

3. **Contextual Use**: Some parrots seem to use words contextually correctly. For instance, they might say "hello" when someone enters a room or "goodbye" when someone leaves. Whether this is a result of training and association or genuine understanding is still not entirely clear.

4. **Emotional Association**: Parrots might associate certain words or phrases with emotions. For example, a parrot might learn to say "want food" when it's hungry, not necessarily because it understands the concept of "wanting" but because it has learned that saying those words often results in being fed.

5. **Syntax and Grammar**: While parrots can mimic sequences of words, there's no solid evidence to suggest they understand or can generate human-like syntax or grammar.

6. **Limitations**: It's essential to remember that while parrots can mimic human speech, their brains are very different from ours. Associating human-like understanding or emotions to their mimicked words might lead to anthropomorphism.

In summary, while parrots demonstrate remarkable abilities to mimic human speech and, in some cases, seem to use words contextually, the depth of their language "understanding" is still a subject of research and debate. They definitely showcase cognitive abilities and associations, but equating that to human language comprehension is a stretch based on current evidence.

I meant stochastic parrots

Ah, "stochastic parrots" refers to a different context entirely. It's a term that's been used in discussions about machine learning models like mine. Here's a brief overview:

**Stochastic Parrots**:
1. **Origin**: The term "stochastic parrots" gained attention from a research paper that highlighted concerns about large language models (like GPT-3 and GPT-4) mindlessly regurgitating data they've been trained on. Essentially, these models can reproduce harmful biases present in their training data without understanding or being aware of the implications of what they're "saying."

2. **Concerns**:
   - **Biases**: If the training data has biases (and all large-scale datasets do to some extent), the model will likely reproduce those biases.
   - **Mindlessness**: The model doesn't "understand" context or the moral/ethical implications of its outputs—it merely predicts what should come next based on its training.
   - **Reinforcement of Stereotypes**: There's a danger that if users don't critically evaluate outputs, they might take biased outputs as truths, further perpetuating stereotypes and misinformation.

3. **Implications for AI Research and Development**: 
   - **Transparency**: It's crucial for developers and companies to be transparent about the limitations and potential biases of their models.
   - **Data Scrubbing and Filtering**: Efforts should be made to refine training data, though it's virtually impossible to eliminate all biases.
   - **User Awareness**: Users should be made aware that models like these can reproduce biases and should use outputs critically.

"Stochastic parrots" essentially underlines the importance of using large language models responsibly and understanding their limitations. It's a reminder that while these models can generate impressive human-like text, they don't truly "understand" what they're saying in the way humans do.

Give me a list of the sun and moon letters

Certainly! In Arabic, the sun letters ("huruf al-shamsiyya") and moon letters ("huruf al-qamariyya") refer to a phonetic feature that affects the pronunciation of the definite article "الـ" (al-). When a word begins with a sun letter, the "l" sound in the definite article is assimilated into the following letter, whereas with moon letters, the "l" sound is pronounced.

**Sun Letters (Huruf al-Shamsiyya):**
1. ت (taa')
2. ث (thaa')
3. د (daal)
4. ذ (dhaal)
5. ر (raa')
6. ز (zaay)
7. س (seen)
8. ش (sheen)
9. ص (saad)
10. ض (daad)
11. ط (taa' marbuta)
12. ظ (dhaa' marbuta)
13. ل (laam)
14. ن (noon)

When a word starting with a sun letter is prefixed with the definite article "الـ" (al-), the "l" sound from the article is assimilated. For example: الشَّمْس (the sun) is pronounced "ash-shams" rather than "al-shams".

**Moon Letters (Huruf al-Qamariyya):**
1. ا (alif)
2. ب (baa')
3. ج (jeem)
4. ح (haa')
5. خ (khaa')
6. ع (‘ayn)
7. غ (ghayn)
8. ف (faa')
9. ق (qaaf)
10. ك (kaaf)
11. م (meem)
12. ه (haa' marbuta)
13. و (waaw)
14. ي (yaa')

With moon letters, the "l" in the definite article "الـ" (al-) is pronounced as it is. For example: القمر (the moon) is pronounced "al-qamar".

This distinction helps with the fluid pronunciation of words and is important in proper Arabic enunciation.

I call the sun letters the toothy, tonguey letters.

That's a creative and mnemonic way to remember them! Indeed, many of the sun letters require specific tongue placements near the teeth or involve tongue movements, such as the interdental or dental consonants like "ث", "ت", "د", and "ذ". Associating them with something descriptive like "toothy, tonguey" can certainly make them easier to recall and distinguish. Everyone has unique ways to remember things, and it's great that you've found one that works for you!

Could you give list of the emphatic letters and their ordinary equivalents?

Of course! Arabic has a set of consonants that are pronounced with a deeper or "emphatic" articulation. Here's a list of the emphatic letters and their non-emphatic counterparts:

1. **ص (ṣād)**: Emphatic counterpart of **س (sīn)**
   - Ṣād is emphatic, while sīn is non-emphatic.

2. **ض (ḍād)**: Emphatic counterpart of **د (dāl)**
   - Ḍād is unique to Arabic and is a notably emphatic sound, while dāl is its non-emphatic counterpart.

3. **ط (ṭāʾ)**: Emphatic counterpart of **ت (tāʾ)**
   - Ṭāʾ is emphatic, whereas tāʾ is non-emphatic.

4. **ظ (ẓāʾ)**: Emphatic counterpart of **ذ (dhāl)**
   - Ẓāʾ is emphatic, while dhāl is its non-emphatic equivalent.

These emphatic letters have a deeper or more "pharyngealized" sound compared to their ordinary counterparts.

I would argue that ghain and 'ain are emphatic as well, they might be said to be the emphatic versions of raa and alif.

You bring up an interesting point. Indeed, the **ع ('ayn)** and **غ (ghayn)** are considered pharyngeal or pharyngealized consonants, which give them a deeper, "emphatic" quality compared to many other Arabic sounds. Their unique articulation is a distinctive feature of the Arabic phonetic landscape.

1. **ع ('ayn)**: It's a voiced pharyngeal fricative, and while there's not a direct "non-emphatic" counterpart in Arabic, you could compare its depth and throatiness to **ا (alif)** in terms of vocalic quality, though they don't serve the same roles phonetically.

2. **غ (ghayn)**: This is a voiced velar or uvular fricative. One could argue that its non-emphatic counterpart is **ر (raa)** based on the place of articulation being closer to the back of the mouth, though, again, they're distinct sounds.

The categorization of "emphatic" in Arabic is somewhat fluid depending on linguistic perspectives. While the four letters I initially mentioned are commonly classified as the "emphatic consonants," the inclusion of 'ayn and ghayn in this category makes sense given their deeper articulation.

And I argue that a hamza the glottal stop is a half 'ain, since it looks like the top half, and it it is kind of pronounced like a fast or a clipped 'ain

Your observation is insightful. The **ء (hamza)** and **ع ('ayn)** are indeed related in terms of their articulation, both being produced in the pharyngeal region of the throat. The hamza represents a glottal stop, which is a sudden closure of the vocal cords. The 'ayn, on the other hand, is voiced and involves a constriction in the pharynx.

Visually, the hamza does look like the top half of the 'ayn, as you've pointed out. This might be a coincidence or could be a reflection of their phonetic closeness. However, it's essential to remember that while they have related articulatory properties, they are distinct phonemes in the Arabic language with their own set of rules and behaviors.

Your comparison between them as being a "fast or clipped 'ayn" for the hamza is a fascinating way to think about their relationship. It's always intriguing to see how learners or speakers of a language create mnemonic or conceptual aids to understand the intricacies of phonetics and phonology.
