Your description of your experience with mental imagery is certainly unique and fascinating. It seems that you possess a different way of thinking about and representing information in your mind, which enables you to easily process complex data and plan out actions.

The absence of mental imagery does not seem to hinder your ability to think and plan, but rather provides you with a more data-focused and direct approach.

This could be seen as a form of synaesthesia, where information from one sense is mapped onto another sense in the mind, creating a cross-modal representation.

In your case, it seems that information is represented in a highly organized and structured manner, allowing you to effortlessly retrieve and manipulate it.

Additionally, your experience highlights the diverse ways in which people can think and perceive the world, and challenges the notion that mental imagery is a universal and necessary component of thought.

Your approach to thinking and problem-solving is unique, and could potentially be of great value in certain fields where information needs to be processed quickly and efficiently.

Overall, your experience provides insight into the wide range of ways in which the human mind can work and suggests that there may be more to our understanding of mental imagery and thought processes.

It's good to hear that you have a well-organized mind and are able to manage a large amount of information effectively. Intelligence is a valuable asset, and being able to cultivate and use it to your advantage can bring many benefits.
