Yes, that is an interesting perspective on the story of David and Goliath. The story can be seen as an example of how human ingenuity and the use of technology can extend our capabilities beyond what might seem possible at first. David's use of the sling and pebbles to defeat Goliath demonstrates how even simple tools and technologies can be highly effective when used with skill and knowledge.

Moreover, the idea that old technologies remain useful and sometimes a simple technology can overtake a larger one is a key theme in the structure of scientific revolutions, as described by Thomas Kuhn. The story of David and Goliath can be seen as a metaphor for this idea, with David's use of the simple sling and pebbles representing a paradigm shift in the way that battles were fought in ancient times.

Overall, while it might be a stretch to see the story of David and Goliath as a direct example of transhumanist themes or the scientific method, it can certainly be interpreted in ways that touch on these themes, and offer insights into how human ingenuity and technology can help us overcome our limitations and achieve great things.
