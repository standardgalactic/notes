Human:

Can you make this more scientifically accurate? Male nipples are not atavisms, but rather serve no purpose in the organism and are therefore not selected for by evolutionary forces.

They are thought to be the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, which can explain why both men and women have nipples, as it is most likely an ancestral trait before modern sex-specific differences evolved.

Recurrent protopathy is a developmental process characterized by the duplication and embedding of tissue with little useful function.

It occurs in embryonic development and is thought to be responsible for male nipples, as well as other non-functional anatomical features such as the tailbone and wisdom teeth.

While male nipples may play a role in providing nutrients for the pectoral muscles, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that they are involved in the deposition of building materials for muscle, skin, and other cells. (My pet theory)

Male nipples are thought to be primarily the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, where tissue is duplicated and embedded with little useful function.

This duplication can lead to the development of dissipative structures, such as male nipples, as these structures are not selected for by evolutionary forces.

To refine your explanation for scientific accuracy while maintaining clarity, let's address some concepts and terminologies:

1. **Atavisms**: This term refers to the reappearance in an individual of characteristics of some remote ancestor that have been absent in intervening generations.

Male nipples are not atavisms because they appear consistently in all male individuals, not sporadically as ancestral traits reemerging after being absent for many generations. (Note: I don't think this is the correct definition of atavism)

2. **Developmental Process and Evolutionary Selection**: Male nipples arise from the same embryonic tissues that develop into female mammary glands, reflecting a commonality in mammalian embryonic development. 

This occurs because, in early stages of embryonic development, the sex of the embryo doesn’t influence the development of mammary precursors. Only later in development do sex hormones influence the differentiation of tissues to develop sex-specific characteristics like mammary glands in females.

3. **"Recurrent Protopathy" and Scientific Terminology**: The term ‘recurrent protopathy’ is not widely recognized in the scientific community concerning developmental biology or evolutionary theory.

It seems you're describing a process where certain traits persist through evolutionary time because they do not significantly impact survival or reproduction (neutral traits).

The more commonly used concept to explain the presence of such traits is "developmental constraint", where certain features are conserved across species due to shared developmental pathways.

4. **Evolutionary Perspective**: From an evolutionary standpoint, male nipples are not selected against because they do not impose a significant reproductive disadvantage. 

The energy and resources required to develop nipples in males are minimal, and thus, there is no significant evolutionary pressure to eliminate these structures.

5. **Speculative Functions**: Your theory that male nipples may play a role in providing nutrients for the pectoral muscles or in the deposition of building materials lacks scientific support.

Generally, nipples do not have a known function in males. Speculative functions without evidence tend to detract from scientific explanations.

**Revised Explanation**:

Male nipples are a result of shared embryonic developmental pathways between males and females, manifesting before sex-specific hormonal influences differentiate tissues based on sex.

This commonality is due to the conservation of developmental processes across mammals, where early development does not significantly diverge based on sex.

The presence of nipples in males is an example of a developmental constraint, where certain features are conserved because they are part of a common developmental plan and do not significantly impact the organism’s fitness.

From an evolutionary perspective, because male nipples do not confer a significant disadvantage nor advantage, they have not been specifically selected for or against. 

This is indicative of the principle that not all aspects of an organism's anatomy have a current adaptive function; some traits persist as byproducts of developmental processes shared across sexes.
