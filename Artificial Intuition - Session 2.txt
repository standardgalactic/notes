okay so hello back again um thanks for

rejoining to the

workshop um artificial

intuition um in order to follow up uh

from the morning discussions um I put

some uh words here that maybe in camera

are not very clear but I will read them

the idea of this Workshop I will repeat

again um is

to come up with perspectives and

questions that are relevant to theine

intuition because it's a very

complicated notion that we will not most

likely will not all leave the room

thinking we know what it is but at least

we will learn some New Perspectives and

we will enrich our understand our

current understanding or new current

understanding so some of the words that

were coming and and I will talk about a

few things that I want I just want want

to share with you just some perspectives

some of these words are coincidence and

I wonder why coincidence came to the the

table why why coincidence is is a

relevant uh element for intuition so I

will just mention this briefly and I

think intuition is something that is not

a coincidence but it looks like a

coincidence somehow because it's not

something we can kind rationalize and so

on so there is a relation there that we

can play and try to kind of make make

more analytically understood then

forward and backward reasoning these are

the Notions that J Draco brought today

this morning and I think it's it's very

very important to to go back home

remembering this so that's what I I

mention predictive processing it's also

a notion that is brought by by Francis

today a lot to to explain the uh the

notion of intuition maybe as a as a

mechanism that we don't have a clear

explanation that maybe runs in our

um runs in our

uh in our

unconscious

so yeah well this was mentioned and then

the three improvisation I like it very

much and I mentioned here because it's a

it's an

idea it's a it's a playground where

intuition can be studied maybe more

scientifically improvisation is like the

the precise place ground where you can

do things then you can ask people why

did you do this let's re listen to the

recording and so on and I have an

article maybe never shared with chrisan

and this surprise and equilibrium uh

which was mentioned also that the idea

that there is surprise that makes

everything fun makes everything

interesting uh or makes life I don't

know

challenging and then so something that

protect us as you were saying so so this

this rationality or this idea of

predicting is a some sort of protection

this idea I like a lot and resonates as

well with with with the things that I

will talk I will def I will basically

talk about three things so I'll try to

dedicate some five minutes to them the

first one is like the idea of nonlinear

knowledge which I've never called it

that way until today so so it's it's a

new con the second is the Triangular

inequality and the space where I might

live so that's the first the second and

the third is idea of

Life towards

intelligence and through a concept that

I call aordance which is a a concept

that exist in this in the literature

with different names but uh but I'm

trying to redevelop so I will try to

share these three things the first is

the nonlinear knowledge then okay so if

you

wanna um if we want to know the world if

you want to think when we think about

the world uh there is something really

interesting about this notion of object

that the things we know from the world

are things that are in the world so in a

in a super um realistic uh real in the

sense of realism in philosophy so in a

very realistic perspective we have a

world that we have to know and the world

is composed by objects or something that

is static something that is there to be

known so we start with this idea of

objects and things that are going to be

known okay let's assume for a moment

that the world is only composed by

objects of that kind but by things of

that kind that are completely stable so

we will know them okay if we go back to

the uh to to the description of uh

dynamical systems in in in mathematics

there is a very fun and simple

description of something that is static

in time it's is static we mean static in

time so for example let's say in very

simple terms a rock is a rock because if

you go to see The Rock today The Rock

will have this all the the molecular

structure of it will be the same

tomorrow so so it's the same it's the

rock it's the same thing okay and that

has a very simple description called in

dynamical systems a fixed point so there

are many intricacies that we can go and

discuss but basically it's very simple

to argue that a rock is a fixed point in

the dynamical system will it at so there

is this notion of fixed

point so what's the idea of a fixed

point if I look in a in a diagram for

example of motion let's think of the

motion of a ball in a table okay so this

is the x axis of the table and this is

the y axis of the table so if I see this

this table I have this x axis here Y

axis there so if I want to draw the

trajectory of this ball that is going

let's say it's a Billard table okay so I

will I will shoot it from here and then

it will do some trajectory like this

let's say I'm in the middle of the table

at the y axis and in the zero uh middle

of the table at the zero coordinate so

I'm here and I shoot shoot shoot the B

so it will reach something like this and

it will do something like that and then

something like this and it will start at

some point it will stop we don't see the

speed of it here because we are only

looking at position coordinates so it

will go up and down as the ball draws

and it will draw this

trajectory once the ball reaches the end

because of the friction the ball will at

some point will stop after that there is

nothing

else so the ball stops and it's in a

fixed point that is reached through

through this transient Dynamics okay

when we look at the at the for example

in a in a something like the typical

thing like this and we draw through a

ball it will do something like

this so if we look at this in this

diagram then it does something like this

uh something like

this uh go back yeah so something like

this we can then that what's the point

here the point is that the object that

we are trying to look at in the in the

space where we represent its

properties it end up having the same

fixed property at some point forever in

this case we're looking at

positions that's these are the

properties that Define what we are

studying positions in two axis and then

the fixed point is the end position so

so is the end property of the system so

I'm trying to move this analogy to the

to the Dynamics of other Concepts so

like I said the rock for example the

rock is the object and it has some

somehow it evoled from big bang whatever

some dynamical system and now we got

this Solid Rock there so if we think

that the world is composed only by

objects this is the and this is the case

then we should expect that everything

that is around us has already already

reach its final State because it's an

object already it is finalized it is a

fixed Point

somehow and this idea is is of course

Very uh not interesting today but it was

interesting for 100 years ago 500 years

ago they were really thinking that the

world is something that has to be known

everything is just there in some space

everything is a fixed point at the end

in some we just have to discover what

the space of

representation is but then later on um

the the dynamical systems uh thinking

came with an extended idea of a

stability which is also very old but

it's called the uh periodic

orbit the periodic orbit so in the in

the case of of a fixed Point let's say

um let's make this uh this this example

maybe might be even better so I have the

the Earth here and then the moon

rotating around and let's say that the

moon somehow loses the the capacity to

remain around the moon and will hit the

Moon it will hit the the Earth so it

will do something like more or less like

this andom and then it will hit the

earth so if we got this is the

position of the of the of the earth and

this is a starting position of the Moon

we will see something like it will

collapse towards the moon towards the

Earth

but in that case it will reach a fixed

point with respect to the air but the

moon somehow remains circling around

circling around the earth it never fixes

its position its position but it's

always changing its position with

relation to the moon but in a way that

it repeats the pattern of of of of

positions so it there is in full moon or

like Moon and we got stages and it

follows these stages the moon

gravitating around the earth is not a

fixed point it's not an object what is

the moon around the earth what kind of

concept is

that so so how do we think about this in

terms of an object the object is the

moon the object is the planet the the

Earth but what is that trajectory that

makes around is that an object as well

that motion that motion is not an object

this what we understand normally as a

process it's the process of being around

the moon so and that's another sort of

mentally it's also an object like the

process is a sort of mental object right

but I think we all can kind of assume

here there is a trick like we are again

attributing the features of an object to

something that already showing in the

physical space not having the properties

of an object so there must be something

tricky here and that's to me uh what I

what I why I call this towards nonlinear

knowledge because if we look at nature

this is the interesting thing if we look

at nature and we analyze any part of

nature as a dynamical system we will

find that the stable regimes the

dynamically stable regimes of of the

system so what remains as such what we

is stable enough to be even

observed will not be fixed points

generally generally what we have some

it's oscillations we ourselves we are

oscillating machines as well we eat food

we have certain levels of energy sugar

glucose blah blah blah and everything is

always uh yeah coming everything is

always oscillated so we our stability in

the world our our our beingness is not

of the kind of a fixed point is of the

kind of a periodic orbit and there are

some other forms of a stability in

dynamical system that I will not dig

into but it's much more likely that a

dynamical system settles in a periodic

orbit than in a fixed point so that

means that is much more likely that the

things to know in the universe are

processes and not objects so why do I

call this nonlinear knowledge it's

because if the system is too linear it's

if it's too simple it will always end up

in a fixed point and when you have non

ities is when you start seeing this

behavior and that is what connects to me

with the with the Hoy tradition and all

this kind of ancient and like really

weird philosophies in from a western

perspective that assume that the the

whatever signals coming from all over

the universe can be telling us something

I think that at least from this

perspective that shows that dynamical

system settled into processes of self uh

preservation

rather than in fixed points objectual

fixed points if we if we take this

argument seriously we cannot discard the

fact that there are certain trajectories

of this kind in distributed across the

universe that are much more informative

of what's going on in the universe than

the objects we are tradition accustomed

to see and try to seek for and watch so

so this is to me the first thing that I

wanted to say that I call it now

nolinear knowledge I will maybe

elaborate someday on this this more

seriously but it's an idea that has to

be has been with me for a while that

that we we when we question seriously

the nature of of knowledge it's probably

more like a periodic orbit than an

object okay so that's one thing that's

chapter one okay so now chapter two is

the question another reflection or

defraction better said according to our

lature today which is the the idea of

questioning How uh um the let's say back

again to the idea of trying to put

things in spaces let's assume that there

is a world of ideas I start we start

with this question let's assume that

there is a world a universe somehow of

ideas in the same way that we have the

physical real physical world we have

another mental World ideas world

semantics World meanings or whatever we

we can call it as we want but there is

another space okay where we can put

ideas and indeed connecting to the

artificial intelligence methods many of

the methods in natural language

processing then to map words to spaces

so for example I have the space here I

will make a very simple space happy and

I would say I don't know

wealthy okay well two to happy wealthy

so if you are uh

sad so this will be maybe to to give a

some some word like this we we think

that now the points are Concepts or

words in this space so where do we where

do we put for example Street dog here

Street dog Street dog will be maybe not

wealthy at all and maybe it will die

somewhere here not not not oh well it

depends not to wealthy and and maybe

maybe happy somewhere here where will be

put good I don't know uh Michael Jackson

so Michael Jackson is is very wealthy

and very unhappy so it's here where do

we put I don't know uh you can tell me

an example if you want someone that is

Happy Lama okay the Lama is very

wealthy I don't know where would would

we put the Lama very wealthy or not I

think he's very

well okay but he's super happy he's very

happy we know and and and and and we

must believe that he's very non wealthy

right that this Lama believe he and this

is the B Lama that maybe I would believe

really he

is I don't know but if you travel around

all over come on the Pope the pope where

is the pope super wealthy super wealthy

he's not

wealthy poor super unhappy super poor

and super unhappy

okay we can put and and that's the thing

that we can start putting uh other words

if we if we we a the dimension of this

space we can other objectives like not

necessarily wealthy happiness and we

will not be categorizing people we can

use it actually for for putting every

possible word every possible word we can

imagine like Freedom what is freedom

here it doesn't really exist maybe we

need another dimension for Freedom we

need another dimension for systems or

for relations or for colors and so this

is what the natural language people do

or used to do in the early 2000s at

least they were creating this like super

highly dimensional spaces and then they

were putting words in these spaces and

then according to their distance they

will check whether a word is predictive

of another or whether if you have this

text then you should put this other text

and actually this is called word EMB

beddings and it's done by the neural

network as well today but with other

methods and it's I'm I'm actually

oversimplifying the description of what

really happens but it's more or less

like this you have dimensions and you

got words in these spaces and then the

geometry of the meaning the meaning

between the concepts is given by the

geometry between the points so whe

whether they are far whether they can be

connected to some other thing or you can

establish geometrical relationships of

this point to grasp meaning

relationships between the concepts so

that's the idea that we can put meaning

in a space so if this works then what we

will say is what is the space of ideas

okay what what people normally actually

believe still today and this is also

another thing I would like to contest

myself doing research they say okay well

it must be a 2,000 Dimensions space I

think 2,000 no no 3,000 no billions no

with a 100 is enough we will get like

and they make experiments and try test

and and do all sorts of things and

actually it works really well but there

is an underlying assumption here which I

will question now which is the idea that

this is a space like the physical space

so the question they guys make is how

many dimensions you need whereas I'm

going to question now the very structure

of the space so and this is why I call

the Triangular inequality because every

space

that we know from Elian geometry or from

like basic fundamental mathematics about

what is a space what is a space in the

first place a space is any set we call

it a set so you need to have a list of

elements which can be all the points in

the space it can be an alphabet it can

be any any collection of things so it's

something

like x y z and there can be infinite or

as many as you want so for example the

real real numbers is a set composed by

zero it has

0.1

0.2 and all the numbers in between the

natural numbers is the most simple set

is one two three four natural numbers

integer numbers count the negatives and

rational numbers count the fractions

real numbers count also the the

irrational numbers which are not

fractions and so on and that's the idea

of set

okay so a space in mathematics is a set

is a set X that is uh equipped with a

notion of distance distance is something

that requires two elements of the

set X1 and

X2 and it will give you a value a number

between zero and infinite well infinite

is not considered so you you make it

like this but you take two two elements

of the set and that will tell you a

number which is the distance between the

number the points the the elements in

the

set okay that's a distance if like I

said between Orion and me what's the

distance okay 1.5 MERS that's that's the

distance function between me and Olga

between you and you we can all measure

our distance and that's what the

function makes okay but now to be super

General about the space distance has

three properties and that's every

distance will have to have that in every

geometry the first is that the distance

between an element let's call it s in

the space S1 and

S2 sorry between S I will make it more s

between a and a so a is a point in the

space the distance between a and a is

equal to zero for all a so for all the

points in space if I measure the

distance between him at the point and

itself it's always going to be zero so

nothing can be far from itself

everything is within itself okay the

other is the distance between A and B is

equals to the distance between b and a

that's another priv property I cannot be

further from you than you are from me

now if you are a little bit thinking

about it that's not what happens for

example in social networks where you can

be friend of someone that is not friend

of you you know you can follow someone

that doesn't follow you so this already

is far from social relationships we can

see it immediately and actually there

are experiments in Psychology that say

that people think that Korea is more

similar to China than China to

Korea so so that is already questioning

like the notion of distance sorry let me

finish the point and and then the last

one is the Triangular inequality which

says for all a

b um and

C the distance between A and B must be

smaller or equal than the distance

between a and C plus the distance

between C and A that's the Triangular

inequality and if we make it graphically

it's very simple I make two points in

space A and B I have their distance and

then if I draw a third Point C whatever

and I calculate the distance between a

and C plus the distance between C and B

then the sum of these two distance is

larger than this one

okay so that's pretty obvious for every

Point any c that I try to look in the

universe will never make the distance

between A and B shorter it can only make

it equal if it falls over this line if I

go C here then I got a and c c and b and

that will be equal just equal but never

shorter so this is to me a very

interesting uh element that to say okay

if we put I ideas in a space then ideas

will have to be of this kind they will

have to respect the Triangular

inequality but actually I have this

experiment that was not made by me but

it has been made by psychologist that

you put the word assassin for

example here the guy that kills for

money then you get the word h

spoon as Ain and Spoon normally you

don't find many connection is not really

kind of not too not not too connected

they don't mean the same thing but if

you put knife in

between asine and knife very close they

always go together knife and Spoon they

always go together so then if let's say

this is distance 10 ass to spoon assing

to knife is distance one knife to spoon

is distance one so 1 + one is not larger

than 10 it's smaller than 10 so I think

in meaning we are able to revert the

Triangular inequality we can go and find

another thing which is the intuition to

me it could be thought as the in

intuition that will allow you to bring

closer I'm not defining intuition Arnold

I'm just like saying that it's related

to this act of discovering in your in

your mental space in your mental

construction that something can just get

bring things closer so make feel the

semantic Gap that something feels

distance or unknown and now it feels

known or close so all these things are

to be more precise I'm just throwing the

idea on the table and now I finish this

concept with with the with the radical

transformation of this Axiom from for

all A and B and for all C this

inequality hold and I replace it with

this alternative that says for all A and

B there exist a c such that the distance

between A and B is going to be larger

than the distance between a and C plus

the distance between C and B if you

impose that for all points for all ideas

there is a third idea that will bring

this two idea closer these two ideas

closer what you are assuming is that for

every two things you think you can

somehow think it better make the

connection faster or or somehow connect

these two

things this has an interesting

conclusion which is which what I'm going

to finish is that it's it's easy to look

if we draw again a

b and then I put C here we will

geometrically it's impossible to find

that point that makes the distance

shorter so I will just make it longer

and you have to imagine that it's

short so now I discovered a point that

makes the distance between a and C uh

closer

and now I apply recursively I now I look

for the new point that makes the

distance between a and C shorter so

let's call it C1 and then from C to B

closer and we call it C2 so now we go in

this trajectory and we if we go from a

to C1 to C to C2 to B it's even shorter

and if we apply recursively this again

all over and all over and all over and

all over and all over again we might

find that the is an infinite pathway of

Concepts that takes a to B at no

distance so A and B will be the same but

only when they go through that I call it

Enlightenment path so so that's that's

something that will it's a geometry that

allows for having things with distance

but except if you travel you go through

some other structures so that's an idea

okay and I don't I have not developed it

further than this but it's really

interesting because it can connect kind

of uh what is mounted the the Buddhist

philosophy with mathematics and with

geometry so it's something to explore

and I will because of time I will um

keep this very very short not even make

a drawing um but and also I'm a little

bit technical so I will not explain the

full

details uh but in our project in our

recent project with EVO and some other

people well Ryan joined to the team as

well we were working in the origins of

gold

directedness and and the basic idea is

that gold

directedness um it's a property that

beings have so you got a be to big old

directory and in order to be you have to

remain in the world enough so others can

say you are right

so starting from this um again we can be

as a fixed point or we can be as a

process right we mentioned that already

fortunately so we focus on those things

that are as a process and these are like

in in the language of maturana these are

the autopoetic systems so then the first

goal of something is to be as a process

for a complex enough system if will be

to be as a process and then um how do we

get from that to intelligence and that's

the evolutionary pathway that these

things um because they receive

perturbations they change their

structure I will go really far here

really fast so sorry if if it doesn't

make sense but these things start

acquiring um Noble structures in them

that might prevent them to remain

self-maintaining so they will break down

and become a fixed point that is not

leaving it will just be like a rock or

it will allow them to uh navigate better

uh their environment by navigate I don't

mean they are able to move even I mean

just to stay around so actually motion

should be a first one of these first

things that a cell a first living

chemical structure was able to implement

maybe moving was something very PR

that things needed to acquire the

features to be able to do that as part

of their self-maintaining processes so

other very very intuitively simple

feature that should have gotten is the

ability to distinct certain things that

are harmful from these other things that

are not harmful if the system is not

able to distinguish those things

eventually it will die right it will not

survive enough so those other systems

that were able to make these

distinctions through Evolution I mean so

systems changing their structure

implementing improving what they are

able to eat and process if they develop

this selective capacity then they become

better if they develop further capacity

they might get memory a representation

of the state of the world a predictive

capacity maybe develop other forms of

perception and that's what it's called

the affordance in in in some literature

it's it can be equated to this concept

of know what to do with your

environment know how to deal with your

environment and use it for your own sake

for your own

residence so I think that there is a

pathway between the origins of life and

intelligence that is just like the

ontogeny of affordances and uh and I

think that this is something also uh

very interesting to think because

intuition it's a concept that we only

think for highly ad Advanced cognitive

systems like humans but will ants have

intuition you know will fixed points

have intuition can a can can a rock have

Intuition or you need to be first a

process so this is the angle I want to

bring like when we Define back if we

want to Define intuition we need to know

what are we talking about first and I

think that this uh setting is a helpful

setting to identify the different

possible definitions will apply to which

possible kind h beings so this this were

my three my

three aspects okay thank

you so kerina would you like to speak

immediately or we can run because we we

cannot go for too many questions if if

there is something urgent maybe we can

do it now

let yeah okay okay I want to make a fine

point on what you said at least me that

us quite a

bit because what I think you've done

right me I'm wrong but you've offered us

a very good analysis of

contextualization it and you the way I

understood it you're shown that there's

two path to contextualization which

happens in any case a linear one the

rational one that we talked about this

morning and then the nonlinear knowledge

one

but in either case for you to arrive

nonlinearly to knowledge you have showed

that contextualization is necessary

right the knif the Assassin the cour

right so that process happens but you

don't have to arrive at now we can

finally talk about the result if the

result is

contextualization by linear

means have I understood you yeah fairly

correctly because I think you've youve

pulled the rabbit out of hat at least

for for

me yeah yeah

this yes and that's all I want to say s

we don't have

to we are reacting

so go you're right by the camera okay so

yeah I have a non linear way of

understanding and echoing with what you

do but I will write it here

okay

already also

matics so if we have impossible and then

we do this and we

matically possible so because we know

the definition of in and we know

definition of possible but we cannot

create it so the thing we can do is to

uh uh do everything possible as much as

possible to turn it as small as possible

so in this way what will turn impossible

into

possible I mean but is I mean as close

as to which is this and so this is one

layer from mathematics and then from the

philosophical perspec AC active so uh so

by doing this putting the slash in a

mathematic way and then impossible

itself really become impossible because

when we use it as a word when you use it

to signify something impossible and

impossible itself become possible but if

we do this slash and itself become real

as it as it is linguistically so that's

my non linear

understanding I'm I'm not sure

about the the operations you were

performing but we can discuss it later

because I I have I think I I got it yeah

that would take maybe too long yeah just

a way of understanding

what okay I I have quick question about

a second equation you said that is

broken by social network that when you

follow someone it's not necessary

someone follows you back I think here is

a very fundamental cognitive

because this is like imagine set is like

set of people in this room right and

this is like distinguished and then I

see someone in the window of another

room and like I see them yes so I create

the connection but he doesn't see me

back it doesn't mean you know that like

the distance is shorter or longer it

means that we are not in the same set

and that's why we just not allowed

mathematically to apply this equation

exactly yes so that's why I don't

understand why you connected social word

to this equation yeah it's because there

is a tendency in engineering and

Mathematics to try to invent reality in

the mathematical structures they know so

people try to make the Assumption of

course you will fail miserably if you

try to explain this this phenomenon

you're saying with this type of fun but

people try oh okay I see and and they

try with language you know and people

still do that and it's as stupid as you

say is what I'm saying that what happens

for language okay so because I thought

really like you know question the

equation for me not because you just can

fly the situation to the non equal

system yeah because this person until

this person doesn't know this first

person they're not One S

so can said that people are not in the

same set it's because there's some

something

behind yeah yeah the sets themselves are

emerging in the Sy

yeah yeah no no I I I mean this this can

can be elaborated first but but and

there are all these dimensions of of the

construction of the set and so on to me

are really interesting never

exped but but I think they you know I

discussed with mathematicians about it

and they say yeah geometry and this is

happens something like this in general

relativity you get a little bit of this

and and I know this this these things

are are kind of being tackled but never

seen them in the cogni science you

know

well

[Music]

makes appears three sets

people s yeah yeah it's auta yeah nice

no no but yeah like the intuition behind

this is to question the actions that

define a mathematical structure that you

will end up using to describe reality so

and this is it's a kind of foundational

question whether the tools we use

because said big problem in N processing

they make this or edings in Vector

spaces they do it in because they don't

know any other geometric structure and

they think that the cartisian map is all

what you need and everything that can be

represented geometrically has to be in a

cartisian scheme you know it's to me

it's like really deep that is like okay

should you want say one last question

from Flo okay sorry I was wondering also

going back to the impr improvisation

side like you're in the process of

associating and then you think of

something and then this this can be very

different from person to person maybe

one person has has had different life

experiences different perspectives than

the other person and also different ass

associations between words so perhaps

for person one A B and C might have a

different way of arranging than the

other person if that's something that

can also be incorporated in this model

and if it's still the

yeah in which yeah this one then

maybe sess in and forth maybe another

person would't even make this

Association or these distances would be

different based on a person's for

basically for every person this is

different I would say so you have a

family of functions indexed by the

differences that you can establish let's

say we got for Simplicity we got only

three concept and we got only maybe

three possible values Z one and two

these are the possible distance and no

other values exist then you will have

that all possible combinations in

principle are ways to represent this

reality right so everything has distance

one everything has distance two zero to

this one to this and so on so all these

combinations are possible in principle

mathematically speaking there is no no

problem with it so then it comes the

question of fitting data

so we will say okay this type of culture

will make this type of associations and

it will get this type

so that's a that's so sorry but to

finish the answer of the other question

is that that do is not really a big it's

not really a a question that will modify

this argument because different people

will have different functions different

cultures will have different functions

we can make these parameters dependent

and that's more like on the on the

modeling side on parameterization of

this thing what what I mostly care about

is about that this structure regardless

of the values there is a third point

that Mak that that's what I but for the

modeling yes that's always depends and

then whether these points are um whether

these points are points you know or or

processes from another space and that

that's something thing I haven't really

got deep into it but but I think it's

extremely relevant to think because it

might be the clue to unveil maybe these

distances better so and that but that is

is only

very I would say intuitive reasoning I

have for the moment so just just like

clue like vag so but vagan intuitive is

not the same so I don't want to misuse

the

word

yeah yeah the the thing is that if I say

this is a rock B is my idea of a rock

that that I don't know if that is it's

the object itself or it's me as a

process thinking of this you know so all

these things is like more like in the

Pian uh ID site that we should anyways

yeah it's it's also question please

because this is something we can discuss

further later you know all this we

cannot discuss everything today so um

now we have H the pleasure to have

Katarina speaking um you can introduce

yourself two three minutes and then go

for your talk so thanks Kina will be on

camera now we lost the we

lost

isting weer so it died ah yeah so we

need to reestablish our Zoom thing I

will I will ask people I let me check

who is who is uh let me check who is

this host now I think I'm host I'm it

moved me it moved me back as

second just get in and then I will yeah

yeah yeah yeah fortunately are there any

questions from the audience in the

meantime because we are running in a

little um no the online audience sorry

no I'm kidding I'm kidding yeah so H

[Music]

clemont yes I like to to create kind of

onology

system but uh then I think you you

much much more like the fix point the

cyle and so you

[Music]

could yeah yeah a stranger tractor and

all that yeah yeah I didn't because of

time I won't go on that but yeah yeah

but I

think I would write it as I exp the idea

new

way yeah I've been uh about to do that

for 10 years

I know I know I know whoever wants to

join in the effort of writing that I

will be glad to collectively write this

paper because I've been really and I

think it's actually even a possible kind

of argumentation towards all the like

tarot and all this you know like the

hobby knowledge or you know like all

these kind of not well credited forms of

knowledge I think they I mean this is a

this is not not that it's not supporting

but it's giving some kind of

mathematical ground to it at least you

know

so question

that thetion distance that us

is geometry

or yeah the thing is that distance it

it's a specific ER notion of of not all

topology has a distance not all

topologies have a distance that can be

defined so distance is basically for the

the the real the traditional geometry of

of space but I think that um uh most of

not well in in short terms most of the

non non what's the non non-re Manan

geometries like hyperbolic geomet and

all that these things can happen but

only locally there is one point that is

like the black hole that bends the

reality bends the geometry but you don't

have that for every single every two

points so so that's that's the radical

thing of the argument that you are kind

of saying that there are infinite uh

warm holes between every two points in

space pretty much is something you know

actually the axum could be said there

exist a unique C point that makes this

distance shorter because if you don't

say it's Unique there could be more or

infinite so there is a first exploration

that should be done when you assume that

there is only one I call it Epiphany

point because it's like the illumination

the epan you know in the sense of spirit

spiritual thinking yeah how is it

related to probability for instance in a

language language model one word

follows another as a

probability

word

is

yeah yeah no I P

is the

distance the thing is that every Mo

every probability model will be finite

you need a finite number of states you

that that that's my thought that you

will never have like the whole Space

accessible you have just like a a a

sample of points and those will be the

distance you had a new point and that

will propagate all the changes in

distances uh the distance will be

proportional no no inverse yeah inverse

inverse yes inverse you're right yes

yeah and if you if you model it as the

inverse of the probability you at this

new Epiphany point you discover it and

that would propagate changing all the

probabilities and that's why yeah maybe

some yeah there are so many you

try to create the third yeah yeah create

B yes yes TR yeah I've tried some I

tried to ask him I I question these

axioms actually the dis similarity

whether something is similar to what

find an find a concept that makes these

two things closer you know and then to

the other as see so but I haven't

systematically explored it so also a

potential research can you let

me absolutely yes and now I can even

make you host you

know another cable for your phone make

host we will ask the audience do you

have a

charger yeah

so

Karina put this here so because here is

the microphone right here's the

micr but this is

I we need a what is it USBC c c cable

does anybody have a

US USB USB USB or to USBC I have it it's

on the table on the

floor with no

no

no this one works

[Music]

that's not what

I does anybody have a laptop adapter

like a Apple laptop

adapter that's great yeah

okay okay next time we need a power bank

right yeah we

need

okay all

right good it's a little intimidating

like

this um yeah thanks Thomas and thanks

everyone for having me over I didn't

really prepare a presentation but I

would like to share something with you

and I would uh appreciate it if you ask

me questions so we make it more a

conversation rather than

me uh giving a lecture or anything I'm

just going to present the project and I

think it goes really well with what thas

was just talking

about

um so I just going to find these

videos

now you know how to get in

touch it's just your computer doesn't

really uh more sense doesn't do

anything you

see your

scre can see yeah I

know

no it's just too many open TS there's

only 13 open TS should right 13 every

new window is taking more CPU

so that's what's I'm GNA try to

minimize you think it's

internet ni

can that

window okay now it's for super

slow okay

[Music]

well

so while this is loading uh since the

beginning actually for two years now I

have been interested in

the notion of origin and nothingness and

how do these very abstract ideas of

origin if we're talking about processes

so every time we talk about a process we

also have to kind of figure out when a

process started so if it started then

also when it will end and this whole

idea of origin and end and thinking of

the world in these terms also

presupposes that there is a point of

origin a zero a moment where there is

nothing happening and how do these all

these abstract Concepts

actually

stand I have it here so I developed two

ways of inquiring about

these

um Concepts one is in language and the

other one is in material in language I

thought can we investigate what origin

is if we treat the point of zero as

point of origin is something from which

like in mathematical cartisian scale

you can come back to as if we are

speaking out of this or language arises

out of this chaotic unordered mind so

can we come back to this chaotic

unordered Mind through language so can

we basically employ a mathematical

function of cancellation can we have a

positive statement that is then um

opposed with a negative statement and

when they two Collide can they cancel

mean can you reach that point of Zero by

positive and

negative that's

inverse yeah so you want the inverse of

me

yeah and this so this was in language

and in material I was wondering how does

this idea of zero or or or nothingness

enter

our uh domain of experience in material

how do we understand these through our

senses and so I started working with uh

vacuum and silence some things that are

we only understand is absences not

directly in both of these cases it's all

indirect

knowledge so here I'm going to tell you

some recent developments with negation

in language because I started working

with AI and since the beginning of the

year we developed in collaboration with

a creative coding studio in the he

called render we developed two words

that use AI uh to for

negation and uh I will show you the

first one is

um inversion so this is a very yeah it's

not at all obvious when we say to negate

something what do we mean because it can

mean that you oppose something that you

invert something that you

um cont uh you're you're doing

contradiction or it's a

contet and so immediately it is quite

apparent how natural language is so much

more complex than mathematics because in

mathematics the inversion is one minus

one

it's not one and minus

8 um sorry is BR mathematics that

studies

that so but but it's not the mathematics

we learn

in a

specific

that

much years Haven those

things well so what we see is that we

have quite an asymmetrical problem when

we are talking about negation because

the moment you try to inverse to invert

something the moment you want to invert

the meaning you are immediately in the

domain of context on which level do you

want to invert the meaning and so what

you will end up with is that saying the

dog is barking the opposite of that is

everything else including the dog is

barking because of the way you said

it or in the context in which you said

it because even if the dog is

barking a question is already the

inversion of that sentence so it's not

at all apparent in which

way uh a s a a statement is a negation

or a positive

statement so I will show you the

it doesn't want to open

the sorry it's just my computer it does

this sometimes it just goes slow it was

doing it was doing really well today but

now it's like having it

battery

quitting quit that quit the other one

this one

also you know Chrome is actually the

worst for your computer in terms ofp

Spotify that's it need yeah

okay so

um so it was really difficult for us to

kind of formalize negation being me

being an artist trained visually and

edin Jacobs who is is a computer

engineer also with interest in

linguistics but also not a computational

linguist linguist so it's quite a

complicated matter but so we developed

um basically an approach towards

using AI for this purpose and I will

show you a visualization of what happens

um

Within

a computational model and this is a

visualization for

us so basically what we are looking at

is a density map of all the words used

in are you sharing that to the to

zoom I don't

know

no

so what we're looking at is a density

map of all the words that are used in

the book On the Origin of Species by

Darwin and we're using the sixth edition

from

1901 and uh we use this text in order to

negate the theory of evolution using

Ai and what we see on this video is a

two and a half dimensional map

of uh word relationships so later in the

video

the

the words are going to appear for the

nodes so the proximity of the nodes uh

is how often the two words are found

next to each

other and um the height of this

landscape basically the height is the

frequency of a word being used so on

Signal PL you can kind

[Music]

of of the Dos in the movie

it's just an animation it's this imagin

space

of language through the prism of the

machine yet this is totally not what the

machine does or how it looks like it's

entirely what Thomas was talking about

it's all about vectors and these models

that we are using

um in this case this model has it it has

300

dimensions for us this cannot be

represented so each word has 300

Dimensions that means that it can

connect to all the other words in such

complex M manners and calculate their

dependencies and

relationships so beyond what we would

think or understand of that world so in

a way through working with this models I

realized that I've kind of entered an

alien territory and I I'm no longer in

natural language territory and I'm not

sure if I'm learning about our language

or about machines

language because they're it feels like

they're totally

different

the

as or they

will a

[Music]

or and then what we also tried and it's

really interesting I was thinking about

this totally intuitively maybe not um so

talking with we were thinking about how

represent

geomet and there are

these Circle inversion algorithms that

he had the idea of using and basically

what happens later in this video is that

this entire landscape gets inverted onto

itself

I think black should

be simply I think inversion like to me

naturally would mean you can invert in

many levels in any place and it's so

complicated then simply taking it for

both whole landscape and inting

then this was one video this is trying

to visualize what happens in a language

model but then in terms of

uh

in terms of

mediation what we found out is

that two different models but what to my

surprise what we found out is that these

language models are actually quite

Advanced when it comes to

negation um something I

didn't

think and if you ask GPT it will give

you eight different modes of

negating the standard negation which is

a a simple negation adding a

um negative before the adverb to the

predicate of the sentence so a dog is

running dog is not running that's a

standard of simple one that's negative

prefix the double NE ation negative

adverb indirect negation and rhetorical

negation and on the side you

can read about them so a little abstract

from

the from the fourth chapter the natural

selection is negated in each of these

models

at some

point uh this this part of the the work

is done with ch GPT at some point CH GPT

also

inverted the Darwin's book

into it became a creationist everything

is as God intended everything is unmut

and as it was supposed to be and I was

like wow perfect

negation

um then here you can see some details

about how negation is actually

asymmetrical and what and actually

perhaps most importantly for This

research for me is that

um to try to negate is really to be

creative because like any other

translation choosing between a variety

of possibilities also looking for those

possibilities is at the same time being

imaginative what something in the

negative can be and so so if machines

are good at negating at understanding

contextually and are able to negate that

means that the machines are not only

becoming more creative or

more uh in

inventive but they are also developing a

way to deny and to

lie because they can take in a context

what something is that something is true

this is a positive statement that they

are now capable to deny it and what we

see is this year just a few months ago

we had a chat bot that

lied that had a task to

solve

[Music]

um a problem and in order to solve the

problem it had to do the capture it had

to click I'm not a robot so what it did

it it went online and it hired the

person to go and click for it that it's

not a robot and it told the person I'm a

blind person so the person believed it

and that's how the robot solved the

problem so we already have AIS that are

have the

capacity to uh

deceive that means that they're are

getting

smarter like you know like smart kids

the kids that tell you the truth they're

not the

brightest and so here you can

see on the left side only the title On

the Origin of Species the five

words in anonymization so all the

possible uh antonyms for each of these

words generated more than 36 million

possible negative sentences for the

title

alone and uh

and I love it I want to I want to print

out every single possible variation of a

negated book I think is great but that

poses another problem is how do you

then decide or how do you how do you

find the value on what is a good

negation or not and that is then again a

subject

subjective decision you got to make

based on your level of

creativity or what you're going for here

on the right side we can see that if you

do want the machine to negate more

creatively then you have to find ways to

teach what you mean by that so you have

to design a prompt and one of the

prompts we designed

was continue the sequence of words by

using Color opposition so black is to

White

like defense is to

offense offense is to attack attack to

counter attack so this was one way to

force a machine to think in the Cy when

looking for opposites because otherwise

it can keep generating this

impl options and another thing I wanted

to mention we we going to talk about

today is that you do all of this

training of the

machine with

punishments we punish the machine when

it doesn't do what we expect it to do

and this backtracking the back learning

what Francis was mentioning that some

statements gain more value when like

this is correct and every time you do a

chpt it ask you how good was this so you

can give it a thumbs up or thumbs up

this is how you are basically fix thing

the the the

relationships but uh every time the

machine produces an answer which is not

what you are looking for it's punished

by points and of course it wants to

perform as as better as it can so it

wants to

avoid making you unhappy in a way this

is how we train the

child I would say like a slave so we

treat AI like a slave right

now that make it more stupid because you

have in real life you have like with a

people would not go and tell the real

thing would like to them because they

would not get punished so in the same

way maybe certain moment you make AI

more stupid by punishing it for coming

up with answer that you don't like this

is actually depends on what we want a to

do for

us if we want AI to be more creative

then

definitely and so lastly I will mention

the last project I just developed which

is on view at the moment here in

Brussels and it was a commission

uh actually I was asked to go deeper

into this relationship between color and

opposition and um I read not fully but I

started reading viken Stein's remarks on

color and this is a very nice area as

well where um talking about color and

experiencing color are completely to

different things some things can be said

yet not be seen and some can be seen yet

cannot be said and

every uh experience of color is

different so I took this one part of

this uh system we built this opposition

black is to White like and then I

wondered how does a machine look for

color

opposition how would a machine know

black and white unless of course it's in

words but even in words black and white

are going to be so close to each other

yet does they belong to the set of

colors or lights so how does it learn

this and uh what we did we used a new

model by open AI the same as C GPT which

is basically all image

generating AIS they work on you write a

prompt so somehow a machine knows what

you mean when you say tree so how does a

machine know

this and

uh

I will just briefly show you

the this is the website of the model

that we are using and it's one of the

earliest models developed to combine te

text and

image and um basically what it does is

the same as with language that creates

these large uh image data

sets that it

runs what they call a

zero uh like without much training it

can start recognizing or choosing the

right uh this zero shot

prediction um and

essentially what it does it it it

creates embeddings for text and images

together yet really weirdly it doesn't

it doesn't embed words as words it

embeds them as characters so it

calculates per character not per word

the relationship to the image and it

does that in 512 Dimensions so it has

22 Dimensions more than a regular text

model and so

um every every time we think about these

relationships that means

that uh I can play this while I

speak

why well I can show you um

I'm going to try to Play It Again

basically now I lost the train of

thought but what we've done is we took

4,096 colors from RGB

Spectrum um so 256 color for red green

and blue so these 4,096 colors we

embedded in this clip model we said

organize it how you think these colors

should be

organized and then we embedded the

English dictionary and we said organize

it how you think it should be

organized and

um and basically what the model did it

created

um you you could say a a world uh of its

own

where certain colors stand close to each

other because of the way we speak about

them how they are in

language yet they don't follow the

geometry of color that we standardly

accept through color theory so the

opposition of red is not green it's

yellow or the opposition of blue is dark

brown and and this is of course there is

a lot of intervention from us because

what we have done and I'm trying to play

this video but maybe I can do it on my

Instagram

um your computer is so SLO yeah I'm

sorry this is the installation you can

see it until end of uh October but I

guess it's better I tell you about it

where that's

um it used to be called labo or actually

it is the labo or topos and it's in bbec

it's an artist run space and it's an

exhibition that deals with art and

language and here I want to show you

everybody

post and workshops website after tonight

tomorrow morning that information and

also the slides your slides so there

will be all this information you see the

website so basically this is what we did

we took this 52

Dimensions we uh translated them into

two dimensional uh space preserving the

distances between the points and what

you see here is the color space as View

by the

machine and then uh what we've done is

we used the opposition of 180 degrees on

the globe to look for the opposite of

the color and we use this method

basically to push the machine to go into

a more creative way of looking

for antonyms and negations in language

because uh every every color has the

most closest

words right so you can find

these

relationships sometimes it makes sense

such as orange is paired with

orange color but sometimes I don't know

like pendant is this San color or it's

very arbitrary but what we see is also

in our language is arbitrary like what I

would ask you what is the color

of I don't know sadness so many times

sadness mentioned today but what is the

color of sadness and so if you would ask

the model it would also give you its own

View and so um yeah and here is the we

created basically the dictionary that

maps all the words and

colors and then we used it to translate

a different poent

so yeah that's what I wanted to share

with you I also had some thoughts on the

previous conversations since the

beginning of the morning but I don't

want to take more time right now so

have

so to the organization

now we have time for a little bit of

time for conversation discussion so if

you have questions now it's a good time

I think Karina that myself personally I

would prefer to meet up with you later

because too much too many things to say

but I will drop some few comments

on very very

short that thing ofation is very

interesting because in in

traditional

mathematics uh we learn the negation as

the complement of the set so if I have

two elements then the negation is just

the we we tend to think that what is not

in a in a given set so the drawing it's

like have a like a universe and then you

take a set then the negation is

everything that is not in the set so if

this is my set X then u - x is equals

no

x 10 that that's one thing but this is a

very rudimentary form of negation

because in this case the space had no

operations in it so then later if you

have a vector space so which is has more

mathematical structure more operations

you can add things you can multiply and

so on so negation starts acquiring more

freedom

so what yeah in quantum theory there a

very important form of negation that is

called Auto

complementarity which is like I have a a

like the the other like the orthogonal

space so if something is this then know

this will not be the rest of the

universe but my P will be this or will

be this so so the negation is not unique

by definition and there are many other

extensions to that in logic and so on

actually the people from the center for

logic and philosophy of science in

Amsterdam are experts on this you should

talk to them Sonia SMS or you know I

will introduce you to them so there

there is a lot to say about that and I

like very much that you were doing we

have so many things I like to

discuss so any other um comments on

Kina

[Music]

I mean now in the last dictionary

yes yeah so it was basically I will show

you

briefly is basically the system is

oscillating between representing words

as vectors and as

characters so here you see vectors being

printed out and then it mixes with

character uh yeah just two things thank

you Gina very much um yeah this this

question of negation is really what is a

good negation I think this was this is

this is a great take what what what you

said and it's yeah it's it's uh thas

what you said too that um the the dog is

not barking what does this mean you know

so it it's doing anything else or is it

just not barking you know and so this is

uh I mean now really talking about

language uh in this kind of sense and uh

this is the one thing and I just want to

add what what went through our mind uh

when you were when you were uh talking

it's um what I find interesting that we

want to be AI

superum uh super it should be reliable

so we have this idea of reliability when

I say uh I'm Christian that I'm that you

think that I'm really Christian and um

and the great oh it's it's a great

because we are not reliable and you you

working with this that the machine is

also not reliable you know so like we

develop this project when it was shown

the first time in May if we would run

that script again it would give a

completely different and much improved

negation of the book yeah it's like

it's like I met you when you were two

years old and now I know you that's the

difference yeah yeah so yeah yeah I

think it's it's a you know and and maybe

it's I don't know it's just an idea that

that that comes to my mind that

um we were talking about mimicking uh

human behavior it it mimics now human

behavior because it's unreliable but we

don't want to that it mimic that human

behavior you know to be unreliable and

this is I found super interesting and

and it is not intended via algorithms

and programming that it behaves like

this you know and this is this I found

super

interesting but this is again these

different Logics no of like I think it's

like this

uh this logic of the algorithm the of

the versus this like complex logic it's

it's a different one is really reliable

and one you just don't know what's going

to happen but if you want an intuitive

machine then you want an

unreliable yeah this is so maybe we're

already there you know and we expect the

wrong things yeah if we want to but I'm

really talking about a

mimicking Behavior Uh without that we so

so and so we can say we did something in

negation that leads to the result that

the machine behaves unreliable we're

trying we try to uh we try to program it

in a way that is reliable but behaves

unreliable and which is the negation of

what we are doing so we we we we you

know what I mean so we are really

working in this direction and is doing

the opposite and and this is another

thing which which I found super

intriguing you

know very much in the ethics of AI

discussion yeah whether how safe are we

you know yes we're training the thing to

do

something actually I want to share

something that I wrote

recently about it but you you going to

say yeah I just wanted to do throw in a

really interesting

uh uh thing about negation that you me

you ask what does it really mean for

parking yeah that's some uh papers from

yeah neuroscience and neurolinguistics

how every time we're talking in

negatives our part of the brain that

does the imagination of what is being

spoken is

off we are not imagining in negative

it's impossible our brain does

not because the moment I say the dog is

not barking you see the dog barking Som

not

barking right and so other other

research is done also with kid that kids

do not

remember stories that were said in the

negative like they simply our brain

won't memorize things not negative

experiences that's different

that's negative statements they don't

per to our

memory and another thing is that we have

not found any species of an organism

that negates so apart from us and now

the machines we're the only two species

that

canate I I once did a performance where

I was reading a text a scientific text

and all I was doing was uh exchanging if

if it was a normal statement I negated

it so it's not this and if there was a

negation I left it off you know and it

really really starts to get uh and if

you do it for a while and if the people

listening to it for a while it really

gets uh strange things start it's really

crazy you know and it really opens up a

complete field of or you you start to

get an

intuition of of of this you know that

there's always this this um yeah is it

absence which which follows or if I do

this at the same time it's the absence

of something else or I do something and

uh but uh I I the effect is the opposite

and these questions and this is I think

in this whole discussion about how to

how to create an artificial intelligence

all this this is a super important field

which is at least to my knowledge not

really explored at the moment it's you

know

it's there is something called exp

explainable T yeah these guys are moving

advancing yeah what is that Brickly

explainable AI is a an area of research

in AI that dedicates

to uh find the way that the deep deep NE

networks are able to explain the reason

why they they categorize the way they do

why why GPT will tell you something it

will explain you because this because

and and that will has to be encoded in

the numbers in the the Neal Network why

those numbers would mean that so it's

people trying to discover Concepts

within the neural me Francis mentioned

that a little

bit um yeah but there there haven't been

like much advanced in that sorry no no

it's good should we maybe like take a

five minute

break now the schedule is break on 10

minute break it's it's and then we have

the videos

showing of Olf and Stefan and then kind

of close the session discuss then we

keep okay so now people take fresh air

Cofe but maybe it's good just because we

originally we were going to end at 5

right I think we're going to run over so

it's good maybe just to

say if you have to leave at 5 that's

fine no hard feelings but Ley who can

who wants to stay who can stay on longer

30 minutes and then for be yeah then we

have beards anyway okay all right course

what are you saying

yeah we have the beers later guys

so ra his hand we

didn't

okay okay after check with him you're

gonna any right I was just saying uh I

could stay a little longer if needed

that's

it

I

because

both this is this is

scary because to fight you

system

yeah

with

this

butr

BS

of from Brown and

apply

comat and

creative

Nar

visual we have

this

exactly but

it

of process lot of people

like and just develop for example Fring

operation together with operation so in

between visual yeah uh operation with

with collection of visual sources and

then rewriting op collection of uh

written sources yeah interr with

discussion about politic because it's

very very politic so yeah uh

contextualized discourse for example we

have a project called Al Europe this is

about uh shifting from the idea of

Europe centered

on based conception of of Europe and we

have this collection of IND usual and

they apply operationally then they

reflect afterward they

created and

[Music]

they it's a it's a

form let's say of manory where people

come yeah a fly operation driven from V

or or creative writing or creative

writing and then you have Al always this

reading of what of the

output uh so you reading

collectiv uh the writing the writing you

you mean the the writing or the reading

of the output yeah let's say that for

example with found you have

this uh M on 5 m w with visual patterns

and written patterns and that's like a

craphy that grows and grows and grows

okay in between of the

visual uh reading of this visual P yeah

have

GRE but this just one one tool we last

year

moment but let's say that I moderated it

means that I work together withed AR on

their own da

operation and also the collection The

Source collection is growing and

growing with invited

AR so it's like a growing library but

it's a living Library like the libraries

of the middle age where element can be

written yeah

see

and so I'm just a bit um yeah for

example this is a very

initial uh initial let's say stage of

the process so you come up with this

this is already there no no there

beginning but we have the table of

matters with this uh collection of

sources on

tables okay

okay so this is

prepared they have the huge

tables and written sources that are very

specific because we lay out them in a

way that so I just one um A4 page with

one quot and in in the port we rewrite

it um in a way that you highlight some

concept making it bigger translate some

so it's

system Beed in order to

make meaningful in this context of of

questioning without having the cont of

the yeah I see I see uh I see and you

but you decide what what quot are so the

quot the the first stage was a selection

of quotes that I did together with my

colleague we are we have the

backgrounding philosophy and we both add

this part in in the idea of questioning

national state linked to boundaries to

language so we have these three tables

that are a bit our

Personal Collection collection of

sources but then for example in this

episode of the project we were in

dialogue with the visual art with a

visual artist who starting from our own

collection of qus provided the VIS

collection okay okay and now we are

starting to work with an economist will

uh rewrite so starting from this two

layer of elction own

layer order to

think but yeah you see

it's

don't

uhal uh

uh yeah

principle just this form of

dissemination um but that

creates

evolutive solation of the we started

from this three points about Europe we

don't know say but we started with this

idea of uh non identitarian Europe we

declin it in relationship with boundary

with uh linguage and this Society so we

have we have this three starting table

of matters and then because we worked in

this uh in this Museum that is a

natural a local city museum with

um with the exposition about

ecosystem we tried to bring the

perspective of ecosystem in the

reflection working

on also on permanent exposition

and

integrating a part of it so that now you

have like all this reflection

about Society uh borders and language to

be thought in a non identitarian way

with another layer that is how to think

as an ecosystem how can I think about a

a language that is non identitarian if I

if I look at it I wasem yeah yeah uh

so

I sound everything sounds really

creative but when when there as

participant so we have big narrative so

you come in this manufactur you have a

big narrative that is deconstructive but

you

have it's not

so so scaring as now that time without

setting without the materials without

nothing without the experience they mo

together and you do it for problem

solving

or this

is up research and we propose it for now

we propos it in the context of um what

for school and

universities in a small scale and for

Museum in as a one we evolutive

installation okay

see when I participate what what

is why do I participate can I

participate as as as a normal you can

you can participate we have um a format

this is for groups of

people and then we contact or there are

some mediating uh organizer contact

School contact uh organization working

with groups of people okay we are we

have good contacts with universities or

people coming from University but we try

to have very very mixed up groups so not

just having students from universi so

uh but we have the form

of visit of the of the manufacturer as

indidual so you receive a form mon

booklet okay some activities that you

invited to do that are Le a guide coming

with interactive way of

reading so you

can but having this proposed

activity more

way and we are to

yeah the PA because of my long no it's

fine it's the great

pause

come

[Music]

back

WhatApp or yeah I was trying to to get

some texts but I think

I let me see they are in my email or in

your wife in my

WhatsApp WhatsApp

maybe so this is

all so this is one link

yeah and

then

yeah so

it's okay Lo and now

Stefan this is

click press Escape oh this is escape

yeah

wow I'm I'm you see I'm not a Mac guy

yeah

oh too smart for

me so

I just want Stefan because I don't know

from which email he

made

Stan workshop on artificial intuition uh

so then he sent it to me via WhatsApp

which means I will send it to you via

[Music]

whatpp

that sound is so

nice you got that typing it's so funny

every time I say is he writing to me

this get me every

time like say next

year all right it gets me every single

time a

good okay so you will get the two videos

we project them yes and then you will

solve I want to share at the end of it I

want to share a little text that I wrote

okay but it's very short and then we'll

have a half

and then we go for for beers yeah it

depends on how many questions raise from

your but but I will close with that just

just to close oh

okay loading so so in the meantime you

can load the Olaf olafs so we can play

that one so we will uh in order to to

make

um in order to make a tribute to

digitality and to the digital world and

to the possibilities to

communicate thanks to

technology as

synchronically in time and in space we

will have uh two presentations short

presentations now by the dear colleagues

from uh Japan and the Netherlands

respectively they will give their own

Spin and share a bit about their

research so of course if you have any

questions to them you can share them uh

with me and I will pass them on so the

first is Olaf and then we got stepan so

okay to

work

okay sorry I'm not muted

now okay so I'm introducing a few

different concepts relating to today's

different conversations and sort of just

throwing out some tangential Connections

in relation to what we're talking about

so the first concept is about play in

game and so and this notion of a finite

play and infinite play or I think

infinite play is so finite games and

infinite games infinite Gam are somewhat

like like play so play as I think about

it is much more like what say what

children do you know it's this process

of expiration shared expiration with

your environment and in a sense the goal

of an infinite game or play is to keep

the game going right like to keep

playing as long as possible so to keep

all the to keep the other children with

you to keep the the game

evolving uh to keep play evolving

whereas a game a game is interesting

because it it's like in some sense

emerges from play

initially but it's also becomes very

like rule bound so a play somehow I

think it's in some these are like

intuitive uh relationships but somehow a

game becomes much more like what we were

describing earlier as

symbolic R bound whereas a play remains

play remains heavan

and much

more self

organizing

um I also find that

somehow game is something which is maybe

I'm not sure I'm just throwing these

ideas out there but I think maybe game

game so a game for example is like like

chess for example right um

whereas play would be more like uh

playing in the fields and and seeing

what happens so I feel like in a sense

this is more like this for's

creativity in the sense that you know

what the outcome is supposed to be right

like with chess there's an outcome

you're trying to get to that

outcome like with the uh with the

example you gave of like a scul a

sculptor who he he sort of can picture

the SC that he's trying to SC

and ah

okay so this is backwards

right so with chess for example you know

what the goal is you're trying to get to

and then you sort of come back from that

whereas this is

for in the sense that you you are where

you are you're playing what you're

playing but you're not playing towards

go you're not playing to end play you're

playing to keep play going and in that

sense you're playing to kind of stay in

the in the present um so this is this is

like towards having an

ending and this is in the sense to keep

[Music]

exploring

[Music]

um

yeah so one of

the so that's one one set of

associations

um one of the from like a really

practical point of

view when I start thinking about how we

might make art and art science in

relation to

AI I think somehow I mean it's it's on

the one hand it's it's it's very

interesting on the one hand I think it's

quite difficult and I think it's good to

already start thinking about what some

of those difficulties can be in relation

to making art with AI or art science

with AI of course in one sense it's like

AI is kind of everyone's talking about

it everyone's thinking about it and in

some sense it's ubiquitous it's

everywhere

um but that precisely because it's

everywhere it's quite hard to make art

about like it's so fast moving it

changes so much like um you know like

for example we make this these images

here with the Dal and so on like already

these these kinds of images feel kind of

somewhat out of date know so there's

this side there's all these pitfalls of

uh with dealing with these kinds of

things like how do we deal with all the

cliches of AI you know like we also see

on the on the

poster how that came because not

everyone was oh okay so we made this um

yeah we made this

poster um actually Thomas

made so Thomas initially made this uh

this image here

um with prom image for artificial

ination mixing

what realism as a as a as a way to like

illustrate today's uh today's

workshop and um and said like can we

make some posters with this image and I

felt like it was interesting to ask

different people to try to divise an

image for the 40 days Workshop partly is

a way to kind of illustrate like the

different different things that uh AI

images can do but also to kind of

illustrate in some sense the way that we

each think about AI so the kinds of

prompts that we would put in no like how

do we think about this Workshop already

it's somehow

like

in and yeah there's you see somehow that

there's all

these paral in some sense because

there's there's all these diff we all

have totally different ideas about what

the Aesthetics are Ai and which is not a

bad thing but there's also all these

kinds

of of what AI can be which I think

artistically is quite difficult to to

figure out know what to do with it but I

think one of the one of the also the

problems with the difficult things about

AI working what art about AI

potentially which comes a little bit

back to

games is this is this kind of this idea

of a glass bead game right meaning it's

this like incredibly intricate thing

this is incredibly complex and intricate

uh thing AI like it's um it's super

fascinating and we can get really sucked

into it but one of the difficulties of

making I've I one of the interest

interesting difficulties about it is

that

artistically you you have to one it's

one of those things where it might just

be more interesting to do it than to

show it

right like it's it's really interesting

to play with AI but then is it

interesting to when does it when is it

interesting to show the results of that

playing with AI and when is it just more

interesting to let other people play

with AI there's a

problem there's a problem with

representation in terms of like artistic

representation in terms of AI and how

are you and how you get over that thing

um so and I

think yeah these are so and I think one

of the things is

to figure out how to you know how to

open it up to other

people um how to collaborate with AI or

how to extend our a bit like Olaf was

saying also like to extend our minds

with AI to become these kind of extended

Minds with AI or to become these

extended Minds with each

other so

[Music]

um with that I thought today I thought

of

a a text which uh short text which I had

written some time

before which suddenly became interesting

to reread in the in the context of

AI um the text is called all thinking is

thinking together I think I wrote this

text to couple of years

ago a reflection on networks and

thinking

um okay going

read all thinking takes place in complex

adaptive systems which as we know are

composed of

Parts which interact therefore forming

relationships between the parts in other

words all thinking takes place in

adaptive

networks the kind of thinking that takes

Place depends on the form of the network

in which it takes place the kind of

thinking we are most familiar with is

the human brain whether we are thinking

about science or art or anything else we

know that the network of the brain must

be involved in that thinking

subjectively we have a mind and we can

suppose that mind is an emerging

phenomenon of certain kinds of

network we also know that thinking is

subjectively different in different

situations for example we know that

thinking whilst sitting is different

from thinking whilst walking in the

mountains our bodies are also a part of

the network of our thinking and how we

use our body changes the thinking that

emerges from that Network so when we

speak of thinking we must also

acknowledge the feeling sensing and

intuiting so our thinking is embodied

verella puts it like this by using the

term embodied we mean to highlight two

points first that cognition depends upon

the kinds of experience that come from

having a body with various sensory motor

capacities and second that these

individual sensory motory capacities are

themselves embedded in a more

encompassing biological psychological

and cultural context end

quote thinking sitting down is therefore

different to thinking sitting down with

a pen in one's hand and functionally we

can write and later reread a note on a

piece of paper a thinking Network or

mind is extendable an extension changes

how we think and what we think the

network can also be extended by

communicating with another person two

people or an

AI and it's different according to who

those other people are a group of people

will form an extended thinking Network

inputting outputting and circulating

ideas to from and in between one another

ideas are not solely the product of one

mind that can be reshaped constructed

and evolved thematically through the

interaction of many mods plus books

notebooks papers videos artworks

computers and so on objects do not serve

us individually but serve to Shared

transmission in a wider

environment not only do physical

materials act as extended memory their

representations also become infolded

into our internal networks in

significant ways La of and Johnson fam

famously write the physical objects

actions and situations such as such as

containers spaces trajectories serve as

mappings to Think Through more complex

domains Lov argues that all cognition is

based on the knowledge that comes from

the body and that other domains are

mapped onto our embodied knowledge they

argue our ordinary conceptual system in

terms of which we both think and act is

fundamentally metaphorical in nature

metaphor constrains and permits what we

can think as it is a fundamental means

by which we can think about one domain

in terms of

another as well as extended memory and

mappings for in internal metaphor

physical materials can have another role

in extending thinking for example clay

plus moisture plus gravity will react to

the impulses ideas and Imagination of

the hands it will easily retain some of

the ideas of the child and yet resist

others if some information is left out

this means that some information is left

in this entails of form of selection in

other words processing other material

any material or medium can thus

participate in a thinking Network in

different

ways all thinking happens in networks

according to Bon the complimentary

conjecture is that wherever and whenever

networks exist of sufficient complexity

with feedback and adaption then

self-organization will take place which

is akin to thinking if not actual

thinking by some broader definition of

thinking and that complexity says baton

occurs in a great many places besides

the inside of my head and yours these

minimal characteristics are generated

wherever and whenever the appropriate

circuit structure of causal Loops exists

mind is a necessary and inevitable

function of the appropriate complexity

wherever that complexity occurs a

redwood forest or a coral reef with its

aggregate organ organisms interlocking

in their relationships as the necessary

General structure a human society is

like this with closed Loops of causation

end quote in a sense both Art and

Science are variations of this principle

artists and scientists are subjects who

both contain an external complex

adaptive Network and who participate in

wider networks or environments

processing happens through the whole

wider Network both artists and

scientists enter into thinking networks

extended cup embodied and enacted with

the things they are studying together

with

others Within These networks feedback

and iteration happen and patterns emerge

and these patterns become Source domains

for metaphorical thinking system

one as Francis was mentioning this

morning I.E to understand a given

phenomenon in terms of a newly formed

pattern and logical thinking system to

does the hard work of checking these

intuitions and following through their

logical

consequences the difference in thinking

styles of Art and Science reflects the

different networks that artists and

scientists consciously or unconsciously

have set up through which to think or to

let thinking

happen Einstein and aser made jumps of

logic which seemed to be inexplicable

based on the knowledge that was

available to them at the time asha's

work actually prefigured and influenced

advances in mathematics even though he

himself did not feel he understood

mathematics however I feel that the

intuition of Einstein or eer is not a

mysterious element but more like an

emergent property of a particular

network of thought that they cultivated

and developed around and within

themselves Einstein's Network

Incorporated conceptual metaphors the

physical space and

travel connected to physical bodily

Sensations through which he could use

the metaphor of movement to infer

possible relationships in his mind in

order to think about space time and

relativity in ways he could not do using

mathematics

alone Asha set up feedback loops between

his observations of natural patterns and

tessellations of mish architecture with

his internal mind and his notebooks the

drawings and observations updated his

thinking just as his thinking mediated

by his hands and eyes updated the

drawings and

observations the new ideas I would like

to think were an emerging phenomenon of

the whole system looking at Asher's

images it would be surprising if he

hadn't thought about the nature of

feedback the geometrical pattern served

as metaphors to think about patterns in

drawing and real space such as

staircases and about complex

geometries

this bomb uh bomb s sites the atmology

of dialogue is coming through the flow

of meaning between and among us all I

see a direct correspondence between this

and Gordon pask's definition of Cy

cybernetics as the study of information

Flows In All media together with Hines

for forester's suggested atmology as a

computer as from the Latin comput

meaning thinking

together originally computers were rooms

of people U doing mathematics and

thinking together thinking is always

distributed always collaborative always

participatory and always

transdisciplinary thinking takes place

in nested complex networks or networks

within networks and the kind of thinking

that takes place depends on the network

actors or agents involved in that

thinking Network thinking is always

thinking together with one's body with

other people with other

components computers other

material so so I want

to relate uh to

close um

um with just this yeah putting this idea

out like how do we how do we turn this

Research into AI into a not a glass bead

game but a collective process of

thinking and

thought and

[Music]

um an open an open

game

and here

to

illustrate what kinds of

um what kinds of noble thinking systems

can we form by becoming ourselves these

kind

of algorithms or playing these open

games together or even um how do we how

do we find this best

um what are the really interesting forms

of collaboration between us and the AI

like we join as we join forces um with

them form a a single thinking network

with

them

um okay sure I just want to one last

thing to Karina earlier was talking

about the negative

poetry um and so I just wanted to show

you with an earlier iteration that we

made of uh negative poetry as a as a

human algorithm where we became a we

become a a collective thinking system

together I

will fast forward it

to around the

[Music]

moment

[Music]

[Music]

invert words

live

word

word

number mental image word

fact Inver word

coming invert words

operation read whole form line by

line keyword search whole

poem read line

17 there's a there's a kind of algorithm

involved in how we collect like

collectively make decisions about what

we're going to which words we're going

to Target and this is this Collective

moment choosing which rule we're going

to

do and then there's another process

where you you take on the rules that

other people have proposed so you either

propose a new rule or you was is uh

answer the previous rule answer previous

rule material is number of calling

someone tra a with coming anyway

occasion we'll um I'll put the links to

this and some other um algorithmic

pieces which involve kind of collective

thinking together also on the in the

links that we sent um what are you doing

there together are you is this prompting

you prompt we prompt each other I mean

this is this I when I was thinking about

uh this today I thought it's sort of

interesting a kind of a short form short

a shorthand way to relate the kind of

work to the you know it's just kind of

artificial artificial

intelligence so in these Works we're

kind of becoming a a computer together

yeah but what what what sorry what are

you doing exactly where you you're not

prompting

uh an AI no no so when somebody says

negate no negation of what is happening

then so it's it's a it's a it's a linear

system so we go one after the other we

go in a circle

there's basically two there's basically

one rule I guess two rules trying to

think clearly how remember cly how it

works either you have so you have like

rules like um you can select a a line or

word or the whole poem and you can ask

that thing to be uh inverted right so

you could say for example line two word

three invert that would be like a valid

um instruction in this game and and who

is doing this the next person along then

does that but the next person on on your

turn you have the choice to either carry

out the current instruction or to change

the instruction and if you change the

instruction that's your turn over it

then passes to the next person okay and

they then have the choice to carry out

the instruction or change the

instruction so collectively it's like

you're trying to figure out what's the

best next instruction

and you also and if you stick with an

instruction for while you're trying to

figure out the best way to answer that

inst of text and you have operations

yeah so what's missing from this is the

is the fact that we're all looking at

the same poem ah okay yeah that's

clearly what's missing from this screen

yeah

[Music]

and this piece no with this piece we why

not I'm I think probably the

straightforward answer is because I'm

not a

scientist time experim

need because

iag could really them

together

conclusion

[Music]

think my question

like L but have

some

ref we did I don't have it uh here now I

mean I could find find it but we have

another there was

another

um system very simple game that we

devised called the Wonder

machine which is uh super simple

algorithm it's just every again everyone

talks in a circle but this time you just

you start every sentence with the word I

wonder that's it you just say whatever

you're thinking about or what you in a

sense or about and what starts to happen

is that the wondering start to interact

and people start to start wondering

about each other's wondering and the

think you do actually get a certain kind

of collective intuition coming out of it

because and so we got interested in that

actually like how certain ideas start to

emerge in the group and people start to

make yeah this process of priming starts

to happen and people start to make

connections and associations between

other people's wondering when you start

doing for a large amount of time and

there we did we working with some these

this a rensa this is a so this was the

should say like the interactions group

so when I was um a fellow at in

Amsterdam uh Institute of advanced

studies when Corona happened we just

kind of we started this group and went

online and basically just made these

like Collective thinking experiments

every

week and so this so these guys ransco

she's a evolutionary biologist conand

evolutionary bi and they would they said

exactly what you said and they were like

we're going to do the data on the Wonder

machine and so they they started making

graphs about ideas and how ideas emerge

through time so

yes certainly but not right

[Music]

now yes yeah yeah

yeah yeah we met with and we were and we

had this Collective uh online Collective

for couple of

years so we are kind of like I guess uh

maybe coming towards the the end

um I wonder if

anybody to share a little bit of

something like maybe that this is

probably anybody Olivia you wanted to

talk five minutes about your your

image

yeah but

[Music]

something people online as well this

[Music]

image uh yeah I'm trying to find it

[Music]

here maybe the

big this one yeah

okay

yeah yes um

the IM

I ex some images

this images I got some

St and the pr is very simple that just

it's just I would

like for mus

directors and in fact I um I put it

exhibition of AI AR in France so

[Music]

um have been working a long time for

this cultural sector in France and I

know

that sometimes the

main artwork in the museum is the museum

the

director himself so I find it fun to to

to make canot work with mus

direct but what what is the

relation between Z and the the subject

of

our uh seminar today is the question I

think of proper types this these images

are made by the

AI and that showed that the AI has someh

now a prototype of a museum director in

his head in his

mod and U yeah this is another image

this is uh a real Museum

director this is a new Museum director

of the ven b i i i St about this image

uh after doing that and you you can put

this image in this series that's exactly

the

same they have really prototype of the

museum director in this model just like

we have kind of model of a museum

director or a politician or serial

killer or I don't know Russian Russian

spy I don't know and in fact I I made

mainly seven of people ports all

different categories of

people um and the question of prototype

is very I think it's related

to uh

Canan the Linda problem of can can

[Music]

youbody

what good so let's think about the

following I I

will so Linda problem in a in a nutshell

so the idea is to to think about this

woman Linda who studied

philosophy was very bright and always

concerned with social justice going

to um going to R protest Squad all that

she was into this thing um then time

passed and now she's 30 years

old and then you get a series of

questions about what would you expect to

be reasonable or likely for Li and they

said

yes which

one yeah this is the the first question

so the first question is that she works

at the bank she's a bank teller so is

she is a I will say bank teller so she

works at the so the second question is

she

feminist feminist so among these these

two questions normally I will just give

the the the and there is a third

question that says she works as a she's

a

feminist

and

works as a

bank so the thing I will not judge you

you can think in your own brain now in

your own mind what of these three is the

first most likely the second most likely

and the third most likely so what people

normally do is they say this is first

this is second and this is third most

likely they tested it with probabilities

with sorting with millions of way with

other sort of situations but the thing

is that if you look from from from a SE

set rational set theoretical perspective

you got van teller here is is the set of

cases in which she's a bank teller maybe

smaller do we say maybe something like

not not so significant she's feminist

according to the description it's very

big so it could be something like this

and then she's a bank teller and it is a

banker and feminist it lies in the

intersection because it demands the two

things at the same time to be old so why

the probability of the intersection

between something and something else

will be larger than the probability of

of the thing itself why it will be why

it would be larger it's impossible

according to this view which represents

the way in which we rationally think of

events and probabilities because this

way of thinking is what itls

thermodynamics the M planets and this

and that but then when you take to

psychology then people tend to attribute

joint categories a higher likelihood

than a specific or or singular Atomic

categories yeah and why it because this

is a prototype a category that we have

in mind you know

uh something that is yeah more complex

in terms of probability but simpler in

our mind you can imagine that kind of

people more

like

this and uh yeah these people are

categories are FS we can imagine this

and I think what is fting is that I uh

copy these categories and you

[Music]

can make solving of

IM and yeah speaking about

can program I has also chck between

Linda exactly as you mentioned Linda

is and I next

question as human as a human exactly as

a

human yeah and if you ask please answer

as a professor of

mathematics then slowly slowly you

understand this but

SL yeah you have to guide yeah to get

theolog yeah when you when you

proong so yeah that's that that relates

a lot to the the research in the

Triangular inquality trying to put

categories because the traditional view

of

it's

know this

IDE theory of categories so the idea is

back again to this space and we got

instances of many like Museum directors

and they all have have some sort of

similarity and then there is a prototype

which might not be any of them it might

not even exist but it's somehow like the

most related to all of them so that was

a way in the 80s more or less late 70s

and 80s to whole meeting and that was

the beginning of

staticage processing like the stuff that

Kina was showing as well it falls from

advances in mathematizing that thing but

still I'm I'm concerned with the idea we

we start from the basis that that thing

is space already and dist and all that

already for Branded as they are in in

our physical space that's

[Music]

expects things from the intervie and

you

say human it's not specific at all so

it's not

informative yeah there is an expectation

of being precise and by by looking at

intersection you show you are much more

precise but it's also simply that from

the description you're clear you're 100%

sure that she's a

feminist like from what she did at

University right so the idea that she

wouldn't now be a feminist and would

only be a bank is like somehow you can't

think that even though logically it

makes sense but it's just

you're primed you're so primed now think

I don't want to I don't want to make you

feel like I don't think you can be

created but all the arguments that can

come up to discuss this have been

already

put with with all we we did a research

this this progam has like 30 years and

we have reviewed like she has reviewed

thousands of Articles you know there are

like how many articles are now I

and then I

made yeah of course I used I used

in and they used keyw and there

was and the the aim of our article is

exactly to show that there are

no equal strategy to solve the problem

and that's why you can drink a lot of

arguments but if you don't even make the

interview the same way to change the

context if you change the like is it

what is more likely or great the

probability of a b it's like really

change the the concept of this problem

this is this was also like critical

conclusion one example problem

we yes I say like the source of strategy

how

toog err how

to my like further thought was that you

suggest that

you I don't think it's a I mean she's

definitely a

feminist

there's no way not so it's not a

cognitive error that's you can you can

say it's logically unlikely more less

likely that she's a bank teller and a

feminist and just being a bank teller

and you're absolutely right logically

but I know in my soul that

she but talk real about

life this is their motivation to change

the strategy

brain is very connected

to stop saying this

isal just like human brain works how we

get the stimul of the neural network in

our brain and if you try to put

mathematics on it you get the conclusion

that yeah this is mathematically wrong

but like if you like don't study

mathematics if you don't work with this

every day and you are for example 4

years old your last time you heard about

in school How likely you will you know

like think about this

problem so you will probably think about

reality how your life experience

your

right

F exactly the point

yeah yeah I my is Maybe

they

have kind of mirror of

our our prototype or

bi the all this are I think um you from

this is cliche this is cliche and um

this is cliche and I

said the mirror

of eyes

[Music]

something change our mind I

think is related to our language

on longterm Lev and change our

[Music]

mind

mirror it's a metal yeah

change

very say you mean kind of

negative not

necessarily negative might be negative

in some respects but it actually bre you

in many other respect so that

sense uh just like rtin are extremely

used yes yes and sometimes extremely

dangerous yeah that kind of that kind of

of cliche of portrays you know you been

known at the beginning of the 20th

century late 19th century about p and so

on Jew to

sign yeah some propotion

right

then can be extremely dangerous socially

and

[Music]

politically don't we call it a styl art

I'm sorry yeah coming from an art

perspective we're talking about style if

I make a

new and I have people wearing fedoras

and you know like the

Godfather then I made the

new we have creative cliches about how

Italians don't want to

be associate but then you have but then

you

ack exactly but that's dealing that's

it's not

bad

relation is this subtitute looking

at is the AI trying to fool to is this

propaganda if you say this is the cliche

propaganda and then you know what are

what the worst that can happen yes I

understand the character the the the

Jewish forer and I fully agree but we're

talking here about the AI is the AI

trying to create here like a golden me

as we would say also in

art our image of a museum

director or yeah am I wrong no no you're

right but

that's Nuance what you're saying

right saying cliche is

neutral we can see it negativ if it's

used negativity but if you use a positiv

more

St you

[Music]

know comp you're

using to something

expectation expectation I think there

are different things I think we have we

can also talk about aryes maybe what are

what are AR types um uh

then but and then we talk about and then

we take into

consideration um that it's not so if it

is a cliche or appetite or a proty this

is the one thing and the other thing is

the power of IM this is something this

is something else for example um this

really struck me when we played uh a few

days ago with m n she told me she

started to to go into the Jazz uh thing

in England in

1966 and she was 60 minutes and um she

wanted to become a sing because JZ

female Jessie and then she got in the

early 70s into contact with the first

feminist GRS and and she told me this

was really something that really somehow

do my mind uh she she told me that um

and was really like when she when he

came into contact with these other women

that it was because of the repertoire of

villages that were around that she only

had the idea to become a jazz singer

because there were only images by women

who are singers not piano players not

dramas not guitar players and and this

is and I think that we have to

distinguish between the power of Imes on

the one hand and on the other hand

between prototypes and archetypes and

this this kind of and of course then the

distribution of images and this is of

course another dimension we have here

place is the the heavy distribution of

images that are happening at the moment

because of which is a complete new

situation compared to going to the

cinema and having magazines but this has

and and you know from the history of art

that that that that the ones who are in

power they they have the images like the

the namings of

the Kings Kings and Queens and

everything this is this is power this is

to show this is us and this is how the

world looks like this is how this is how

life looks like and this is what these

are

different uh as you said it's super

complex thing that we are touching with

on different

levels okay

I think it's the the fundamental of all

cre the

one means you want to have an idea how

the typical

Museum on the other hand we want to

discover new things so maybe we might

want to find a museum director that is I

don't know black or Muslim or who is

not and there this fine line between

staying in the things that are known not

predictable un stable and going Beyond

which is always a Lis also a Lis

probably something that's better and I

think one of the dangers with AI in this

respect is if it kind of finds the

cliches the exteror types the defa

assumptions and people are going to use

them from AI then they will confirm the

stereotypes then AI will pick up this

new stereotyp and what you get after a

while is that if you Fe AI with itself

becomes more and more stereotypical and

that's the danger that you reduce the

variety so one of the dangers with AI

sometimes you can say AI typically will

write a better text than the average

person but the text will be more

predictable so if you would feed AI with

text generated by AI they become more

and more

predictable very nicely written fluid

smooth sticks to very predictable so

that's why you need an injection of

people who experiment who go outside of

the cliches and that can then help the

to learn ways but yeah that dang AI

helps in some respect but if you R too

much on

[Music]

it is a printing ter right

there certain letters that go together

more often so they have a a piece that

does that letter like

sure actually what is the line between

the definition of of something and the

pr of something because in a way they

both Ser in some ways but I don't say

they are identic there is a very thin

line I would say What's the definition

of director is it that they're white

no they have almost all of them deped

with the background of some art words

but is that the definition or that the

Muse direct the

defition their Museum direct I would not

have known maybe there's something wrong

with me but I was just looking

[Music]

I mean you could put me there and I

would kind of fit and I never thought in

my life to

be so I'm part of I'm not even

aware maybe there

is waiting from you

[Music]

don't think the background is

here

of very C

is that we don't use of

apply and then make a

decision

further but then also on this window

problem also

thats you

have the idea

because of

very and this I

examp have two birs the tree one how

many how many differents

[Music]

Tre

[Music]

[Music]

that's also that's also the kind of

question normally speaking the visual is

better than

right because you can visualize the see

see going one the get shot everyone fly

so it's also interesting this um yeah

this kind of interiority know like a

course like that

internal I guess we we can close I I

have this small comment about the the

museum director

definition uh just to and and I want to

mention something about the the

imposses um around this this topic um I

don't see myself anyways

um the there is a distinction in the

definition and prototype which maybe is

easy to to to to draw which is the and

this comes from the notion of how to

define something so there are

definitions that are called extensional

and

intentional the extensional definitions

would be like what we see here and they

show us what's the what what is a dog

you get a picture of all the possible

dogs and that is a definition of a dog

like the database all dogs is the notion

of dog encoded extensionally in the

extension of what the concept can

intentionally would be to make a

definition in terms of its properties so

actually the extensional definition is

uh Museum director one or Museum

director two or blah blah blah blah so

you make a

a disjunction of possibilities in

reality instead Museum director

definition I don't think it

encodes uh being white or being European

or being Museum director is something

maybe definition it works at the

institution of a museum and it has the

role of a direct you know maybe for that

you need a specific degree maybe for

that you need a specific experience and

then you can list that so then you will

have a list of properties list of

properties so property one and property

two and property three and so on so and

this is n some logic so I will say

and so you get the extension of

definition is a disjunction of instances

the intentional definition is a

conjunction of properties so it's it's

it's like dual with two each other

again extensional is disjunction of

instances or or or or database

intentional is conjunction of properties

so this property and the property and

the property and the proper so another

way saying that one of them is

differences and the other ones is is

similar

not exactly that's another way all

everything everything all the things at

the same time yeah so this is property

one and property two so like it bars and

it has four legs and I don't know it's a

mam okay you get

dog meow then you get C but if I give

you the the the the sord of s sorry if I

give you the list of dog then that's

extension okay so one is or and one is

and just let me say that this

conjunction this is the the strategy

also it is a museum director if it has

to follow

in and so um the interesting thing about

this is that Ai and all these

statistical methods and distributional

models they learn from data so they only

can learn this way and they don't even

know they they cannot know the

intentional def

they only we can build intentional

definitions by using logic and then

using like the the the relations that

logic allows to encode for what we as

humans think of intentionally and then

embedd it into our programming language

that will mimic as we encode intentional

Notions but they only en they are only

able to calculate instances in the end

ones and zero bites and

representations of objects so so the

thing that when you encode in this

way what properties of the reality you

are actually encoding and which and how

do you sample them then the that's

that's a thing that giving a a very fair

sample according to the state of reality

of something doesn't mean that the

system is going to be learning the

properties of that something it's not

learning these pictures don't encode

clearly that I don't know that the

person has a art history degree or

something like that that that that which

is maybe let's say a or management

capacity something like that it's not

clear in the picture what it's clear in

the pictures maybe the most sent

pictures of what the category is in the

world of the keychain yeah right there

but that might not be the qualities that

are needed for for the concept itself so

that's how the system can kind of get

confused about what the reality that is

representing and and that's what the

bias is can be dangerous because

supplies one set for example one

set see more like

yeah yes yes and that's that's yeah so

so but those more

more predictable properties and maybe

not the most relevant properties for the

con that's that's where the problem

comes equate these two things it would

be perfect it's not

the for

example said we

can Russian or something right yeah if

we change

it yeah only this

specific set the most predictable from

Human OB we can give it the name of

yeah well um yeah it's time for for a

beer I guess so I want to share a very

short uh text which I I I think it's uh

relevant for for closing because of the

intuition uh concept that we are

discussing um and I think it's it

confirms

somehow

um the the learning and also before

closing I want to I want to thank

everyone for coming and also especially

the students to to share later on their

um their writings their questions

because we we would like to do some some

sort of followup to this um and and try

to explore together maybe in the future

I don't know exactly when but but

explore further what we are learning

today so many many new ideas think um

yeah

so let me share this okay here it is so

is everybody know is familiar with the

three transformations of

n no okay no who knows the three

Transformations n the three three three

three transformations of of n n no okay

so then I will read it

yeah you know of

course

so it's very short it's like two minutes

maybe maybe this today AI system systems

can match us in many cognitive skills

when appro appropriately trained and use

but we still feel different to them we

still feel different to AI systems this

is not anymore because we are better

than them at understanding things but

because we can set our own values and

loads and they canot so um this at the

recent talk with by Olaf and yo I had an

idea about how such a difference between

Ai and us might disappear in the future

the idea is inspired by this ver spoke

SRA by nich specifically but one small

chapter called the r transformations of

the human Spirit which very shortly goes

like this there are three stages in the

first stage called The Camel the human

spirit is camel that obedient

accepts societal Norms traditions and

moral codes without questioning them

then then it evolves into a second lion

stage where it fiercely Rebels against

the constraints and values imposed by

Society in the last child stage the

individual creates its own values and

Lees free from external

impositions so these three stages of the

a Spirits which is much more research

investigated and so on but I made an

analogy and I call the C but I I call it

like c a i

c

AI represents the early stages of AI

characterized by supervised learning and

Rule based algorithms it follows human

rules either by programming logic or by

programming calculations it follows

predefined rules and patterns aiming to

imitate how we deal with tasks so this

stage presents no risk to humans because

it's totally controlled by Design and

operation by us then the lion moves this

Beyond this simple instruction and it

begins to make independent decisions not

anymore imitating or being controlled by

humans but evaluating the consequences

of their act of its actions using some

Fitness or correctness functions that

can be given by the humans or they can

try themselves so machine learning

models like deep reinforcement learning

are the the kind of thing like that

today I think AI systems are starting

this era and they are becoming

increasingly able to autonomously learn

and adapt based on feedback based on the

feedback they receive from their actions

from the responses they like or not like

and the Lion now is perceived as a

threat by many people because we cannot

understand exactly how it learns and and

how could and that could act eventually

harmfully to us however I think that

it's very important to not this that

this lion stage

the

lion the lion is still a rather basic

form of intelligence because it's not

yet free to attach or detach from the

feedback that it receives from the

correctness

criteria now the child

okay the

child so will become able not to adapt

just bya function driven feedback but

also in creative ways that will possibly

encode experimentation and play so this

is the most important part of for me to

to say

here it seems necessary on the one hand

but in order to be able to create sorry

in order to be able to create these

Childs you know so AIS that can

experiment that can play not just solve

problems and find they can learn what is

important what is by in a playful way so

in order to reach this and we need

to understand first how goals and values

emerge and evolve and on the other hand

we have to find ways for systems for

artificial systems to attach and detach

from these values in an autonomous way

in autonomous ways and I believe that a

closer inspection of how ourselves and

the collectives we are part of

established processes of goal formation

evaluation Evolution will be an

important source of inspiration for

unveiling the mechanisms that will drive

not just the next generation of I but

also our relation to them so yeah this

is the text I wanted to share because I

I

I I I honestly think that this

artificial intuition thing and the

relationship with AI is just a starting

we really need to think of what would be

playing and and more information so now

thank you to all the people coming in

the in online so we thank you very much

I think camera

is yeah everybody is leaving there

yeah

yeah

great okay

oh let's stop the recording

sorry
