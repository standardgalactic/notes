The Omniscient Universe Theory posits that the physical universe has intelligence because the existence of objects serves as a form of memory. 

The theory proposes that the strategy of note-taking, flashcard making, sound recording, photographs, drawings, etc. and directed acyclic graphs, as proposed by Judea Pearl, can think.

The theory suggests that even simple objects such as pebbles, tokens, clay impressions, and symbolic representations have the ability to function as memory and perform calculations.

The theory also proposes that even complex systems such as ant colonies, termite mounds, bird swarms, and large language models can possess intelligence and understanding, regardless of the substrate they are implemented on, be it a flock, a forest, a human brain, or a computer.

The final corollary of this theory is the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) hypothesis, which posits that thinking can occur independently of the physical substrate it is implemented on.

-The abacus, a lined tablet with beads that can slide along the lines, is an example of SITH. It is used for basic arithmetic and can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

-The beaded abacus, also known as the abacomat or soroban, is another example of SITH. It is a handheld device with beads that can be manipulated to perform mathematical calculations.

-The geometer's drafting table, a flat surface with a grid of lines, is an example of SITH. It is used for drawing geometric shapes and solving mathematical problems.

-The slide rule, a ruler-like device with sliding parts, is an example of SIT. It is used for performing mathematical calculations, particularly multiplication and division.

-The magic eightball, a toy that is shaken and gives a random answer to yes or no questions, is an example of SITH. It uses a set of pre-written answers to give a response to a question and can be used for entertainment or decision-making.
