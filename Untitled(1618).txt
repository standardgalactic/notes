Mufflerizer

Removes explosions, gunshots, crashes, screams, yelling, and other extremely loud sounds from movies, replacing them with dubstep like sound effects.

Learns from watching volume and mute button usage, from facial expressions (cringe detector) and heart beat, as well as manual labeling, sentiment analysis.
