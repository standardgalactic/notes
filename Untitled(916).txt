Bayesian gluing, in the context of computational modeling and statistical inference, is a concept that combines different pieces of information or models together using Bayesian principles. Imagine you have different pieces of a puzzle, and each piece represents a different aspect or part of a bigger picture. Bayesian gluing is like putting these puzzle pieces together to create a complete picture. Each puzzle piece represents a specific model or source of information, and by combining them, you can get a more comprehensive understanding of the whole system. In Bayesian gluing, each piece of information or model is represented by probabilities. These probabilities describe the likelihood or confidence of a particular event or outcome occurring. By using Bayesian methods, we can update these probabilities based on new evidence or observations, allowing us to refine our understanding of the system. The process of Bayesian gluing involves taking the probabilities from different models or sources of information and combining them in a mathematically rigorous way. This allows us to create a unified model that incorporates all the available information. By doing so, we can make more accurate predictions, estimate uncertain quantities, and gain insights into complex systems. To summarize, Bayesian gluing is like putting puzzle pieces together to form a complete picture. It involves combining different models or sources of information using probabilities to create a unified understanding of a system. It's a powerful tool for making predictions and understanding complex phenomena.

We discussed it earlier, you said: The gluing property in Bayesian mechanics refers to the ability to combine models or systems by "gluing" them together based on shared boundaries or interfaces. The gluing property enables the seamless integration of information and computations across multiple levels or domains in compositional active inference.
