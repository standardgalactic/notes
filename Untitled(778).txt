Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is an eating disorder in which people avoid eating or eat only a very narrow range of foods. This can be either due to the sensory characteristics of food, such as its appearance, smell, texture, or taste, or due to fear of negative consequences such as choking or vomiting. Others might show no interest in eating or food.[1]
