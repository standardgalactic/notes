The blog post you shared has several connections with the previous topics we discussed:

1. **Brain Function and Behavior:** The post delves into the role of the brain in shaping human behavior and societal dynamics. This aligns with our discussions about the behavior of ants and termites, which are also influenced by the neural processes within their tiny brains.

2. **Neural Development and Societal Formation:** The idea that brains are "built from the inside" and that individuals within societies develop neural representations of each other resonates with our exploration of how ants and termites communicate through pheromones and form organized societies.

3. **Group Dynamics and Identity:** The distinction between groups and societies, as discussed in the post, relates to our conversations about swarm behavior, where individuals within a group (e.g., ants in a colony) recognize each other, while societies (e.g., larger ant colonies) may not have individual recognition but rely on markers and roles for interaction.

4. **Language and Identity:** The mention of language and stories about origins as aspects of identity connects with our discussions about the origins of words, etymology, and the evolution of language in various cultures.

Overall, the post provides a broader perspective on how brain development and neural processes play a crucial role in shaping societal structures, behaviors, and identity, which aligns with the themes we explored in our previous discussions.
