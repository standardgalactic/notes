It does, thank you. But you don't lose points for popping a bubble, you lose all your points when the game is reset, unless you are blinking.

You want to not pop certain bubbles because you should look to find the most nested bubble (innermost scope).

ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. Thank you for correcting me. You are correct that popping a bubble does not result in a loss of points.

The points are only lost when the game is reset, except for players who are blinking, who will not lose their points. 

And you are also correct that finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope) is important in the game. Thank you for clarifying these points.

Ok a final summary.

ChatGPT
Sure! Here's a summary of the topics we covered in this conversation:

We started by discussing the impact of a researcher's measurement choice on performance.
Then we talked about Spherepop, a hypothetical 3D programming language where programs are written by growing bubbles and evaluated by popping them.

We then shifted to discussing Haplopraxis, a space exploration and typing tutor game. The goal of the game is to explore planets by flying a spaceship and popping bubbles associated with vocabulary words.

You lose all your points if the game is reset, except if you are blinking, which can be enabled with autoblink or super autoblink.

The global reset key is 'g'.

Finally, we clarified some of the details about the game, including the controls for flying the spaceship and the mechanics of popping bubbles and avoiding resets.

I hope this summary is helpful!
