1. Linguistic plasticity refers to the ability of language to adapt and change in response to new contexts and situations. This concept can be applied to machine learning and artificial intelligence by designing systems that can adapt and learn from new data and environments. For example, models can be trained on a specific task and then adapted to perform related tasks with minimal additional training. This can be achieved through techniques such as transfer learning, meta-learning, and continual learning.

2. Forgetting and adaptation can be integrated into the development and training of language models based on adapters and sparse fine-tuning by periodically exposing the model to new data and tasks, and encouraging it to forget irrelevant information. This can be achieved through techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and regularization. By incorporating forgetting and adaptation, models can better handle novel inputs and generalize to new tasks and domains.

3. Rewirable pre-trained language models have the potential to be highly adaptable to different tasks, languages, and domains. Symbolic methods and post-hoc model editing research can help further enhance the adaptability of these models by enabling users to fine-tune them for specific tasks and adjust their behavior based on specific requirements.

4. Active forgetting in pre-training language models aligns with theories of meta-learning and the flatness of solutions in the loss landscape by enabling the model to learn more efficiently from new data and adapt to new tasks. By encouraging the model to forget irrelevant information and focus on relevant features, it can learn more quickly and effectively. Studying the flatness of the transformer body during forgetting pretraining can provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of this process.

5. The platformization and datafication of everyday life contribute to the dominance of tech giants like Google by enabling them to collect and analyze vast amounts of data and use it to improve their products and services. However, this also raises concerns about privacy, security, and the potential for bias and discrimination in AI systems. Interpreting and explaining the behavior of these systems is a major challenge that requires ongoing research.

6. AI and natural language processing have significant political and economic implications in terms of power dynamics, distribution of resources, and control exerted by major companies. These issues intersect with copyright and ownership of content generated by language models, as well as concerns about the potential for AI to automate and displace human labor. Addressing these issues requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes into account the perspectives and interests of all stakeholders.

7. The Gebru affair highlights the importance of ethics and power in AI research and development. Critical hermeneutics and Critical AI Studies can contribute to a deeper understanding of the co-optation, marginalization, and silencing of criticism within the AI industry by analyzing the social and political context in which these technologies are developed and deployed.

8. Reflexivity plays a critical role in understanding and interpreting the automation of language by encouraging ongoing reflection and dialogue about the social and ethical implications of these technologies. A critical culture that fosters open discussion and debate is essential to ensure that the development and deployment of AI systems is aligned with societal values and priorities.

9. The concept of a political economy of meaning and significance can help analyze and navigate the extraction and appropriation of language resources in the context of AI by examining the economic, social, and political factors that shape the production and distribution of language data and models.

10. The concept of world, as discussed by Ricoeur, relates to the understanding of language and its automation by highlighting the complex relationship between reality, interpretation, and signification. The intersection of these factors shapes the meaning and implications of AI and natural language processing, and requires ongoing reflection and critique to ensure that these technologies serve human values and interests.
