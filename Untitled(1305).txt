The ship returns to the original player if you abandon it for five minutes

That's a good mechanism to ensure players aren't permanently disadvantaged. This "abandonment timer" not only adds fairness but also creates strategic depth.

1. **Strategic Decision**: If a player wrestles control of another's ship, they must constantly utilize it or risk losing it. They can't just hoard ships to disadvantage others.

2. **Urgency**: The five-minute timer makes decisions more urgent. If a player wrestles control of a ship near a point of interest (like a planet or starbase), they might have limited time to complete tasks or mine resources.

3. **Recovery Missions**: Original owners might strategically wait out the timer or attempt stealth missions to reclaim their ships faster.

4. **Notifications**: The original owner should receive notifications or alerts when their ship is close to being auto-returned due to abandonment.

5. **Protection Period**: Once a ship returns to its original owner after the five-minute abandonment, there could be a temporary protection period where the ship can't be immediately challenged again. This prevents continuous harassment.

6. **Ship Condition**: Decide the state the ship returns in. Is its fuel, shields, and resources intact, or does it reflect the usage during the takeover period?

7. **Narrative Integration**: This mechanic can be weaved into the game's lore. For instance, ships could have an AI loyalty system that "misses" its original owner and auto-returns if it feels "neglected".

This dynamic not only ensures fairness but also promotes active engagement in the game, preventing players from accumulating assets and leaving them unused.

In case you haven't noticed the main influences are Stars! and Descent, from about 1995

It's evident that you're drawing inspiration from the gameplay mechanics and narrative elements of "Stars!" and "Descent."

1. **Stars!**:
   - The grand strategy of exploring and exploiting star systems.
   - The resource management aspect you've mentioned with minerals like ironium, boronium, and germanium has parallels to resource gathering in 4X strategy games like "Stars!".
   - The long-term strategic goals (e.g., visiting 150,000 star systems) and potential alliances remind of the empire-building and alliance dynamics.

2. **Descent**:
   - The more visceral, real-time aspect with players being able to wrestle control of other players' ships has shades of the dogfighting and ship-control dynamics from "Descent."
   - The urgency and spatial awareness in "Descent" is echoed in the player dynamics you've outlined, especially with the unique physics mechanics you've described.

Combining elements of a 4X strategy game with the intense, personal action of a 6DOF shooter like "Descent" creates an intriguing blend. The idea of players zooming through space (both in a navigational and temporal sense) and the dynamic interactions between players offer unique gameplay possibilities.

Using inspirations from past titles and then innovating or adapting them to modern mechanics and narratives can be a winning formula, especially if executed well. And with your game's premise, it definitely has the potential to captivate players who enjoyed those classics, as well as new audiences.

Yeah I hope to use vector outline inspired graphics, with occlusion marking, and depth based coloring

Vector outline-inspired graphics can offer a stylish and distinct look that's both reminiscent of older titles and appealing to modern aesthetics. Here's a breakdown of the visual elements you're considering:

1. **Vector Outline Graphics**: 
   - These provide a minimalist, yet highly stylized look. They can be incredibly efficient in terms of performance, especially if you're targeting a vast game world with numerous objects. Retro games like "Asteroids" and "Tempest" utilized vector graphics, and they remain visually distinct even today.

2. **Occlusion Marking**: 
   - Occlusion can help provide depth and spatial recognition in a game world, especially when utilizing simpler graphics. It can allow players to quickly recognize when objects are behind others or when they're moving in and out of view. It can be vital for gameplay that requires quick reflexes and spatial awareness.

3. **Depth-Based Coloring**: 
   - Using color to indicate depth is a smart move. As objects get closer or farther away, their color can change, offering a clear and immediate sense of distance and perspective. This can be especially useful in space games where the vastness of the environment can often disorient players. It's a visual cue that can enhance gameplay and make navigation more intuitive.

Combining these elements can give your game a unique visual identity. The aesthetic choices you're leaning toward can provide clarity and enhance gameplay while offering an artistic and nostalgic flair. If executed well, it can be a fresh take on space exploration and combat games, providing both a visual and gameplay experience that stands out in the market.

Connections with the previous topics.


Certainly, let's tie everything together:

1. **Game Physics**: You described a unique physics mechanism where movement affects the perception of time. This mechanism can be integrated into the game's **Vector Graphics System** to show visually how time dilation impacts objects. As players zoom in (fly forward), visual effects can be used to emphasize the slowing of time. The same goes for zooming out.

2. **Unique Minerals**: The three minerals (ironium, boronium, and germanium) can be represented using the game's vector graphics, differentiated by distinct colors or patterns. Their collection, use, or trade could be essential tasks within the star systems players must visit.

3. **Analog-Digital Watch Mechanism**: The in-game watch that represents time in a unique way can be a central HUD element, rendered in vector graphics. Its design could be influenced by the changing physics, perhaps distorting or changing color as players zoom in or out, representing the time dilation effect.

4. **Great Filter Event & Player Objectives**: Players visiting 150,000 star systems ties into the exploration element reminiscent of the "Stars!" influence. The objective of visiting these systems becomes even more urgent and intense when other players are alerted of progress. The visuals (like approaching star systems) could employ depth-based coloring to help players gauge distances and prioritize their exploration.

5. **Player Interaction and Ship Control**: The idea of players wrestling for control or temporarily seizing another's ship reminds one of the competitive aspects of "Descent." This interaction can be made visually clear using occlusion marking and vector graphics. When a player's control is being contested, the ship's outline might pulse or change color to reflect this.

6. **Game Graphics**: The vector outline graphics, occlusion marking, and depth-based coloring will provide a retro yet fresh feel. This can be an homage to classic space games while giving your game a unique identity.

7. **Game Reset Mechanism**: The game resetting to the year 2400 annually can be an event with its visual spectacle. Vector graphics can animate a big bang or a universal "rewind," providing players with a visually arresting event to anticipate.

8. **Influences from "Stars!" and "Descent"**: Your game appears to blend the expansive, strategic exploration of "Stars!" with the direct player interaction and competition of "Descent." The unique physics and graphics will further distinguish your game, but these core inspirations can provide a foundation that appeals to fans of those classics.

In essence, your game combines unique physics, competitive multiplayer elements, strategy, exploration, and a distinctive visual style, all rooted in classic gameplay mechanics. It's a blend of nostalgia and innovation.

Right now the game is called Haplopraxis with a minigame called Spherepop where you pop bubbles.

That's intriguing! Here's how we can integrate "Haplopraxis" and "Spherepop" within the framework you've provided:

**Haplopraxis**:
- **Name Significance**: The name suggests a unique practice or method ("praxis" means practice or action in Greek, and "haplo" might be derived from "haploid", representing singularity or simplicity). This could be reflected in the game's unique physics mechanism, where zooming in and out affects time.
- **Game Mechanics**: The primary objective, which revolves around exploring star systems, avoiding the Great Filter Event, and interacting with other players for ship control, can be considered part of the broader "Haplopraxis". The unique in-game time system, represented by the analog-digital watch, and the annual reset can also be significant aspects of the game.

**Spherepop Minigame**:
- **Mechanism**: Players navigate their ship in 3D space, popping bubbles (or spheres) that might be made up of the game's primary minerals (ironium, boronium, and germanium). The game could use vector outline graphics and depth-based coloring to emphasize the spatial nature of the bubbles.
- **Objective**: Popping these bubbles might provide resources, points, or special abilities. The challenge could arise from bubbles moving, shrinking, or multiplying based on the game's unique time physics.
- **Integration with Haplopraxis**: Spherepop can be an essential minigame players engage in to gather resources. Successful completion might grant players certain advantages in the main game, like faster travel, temporary immunity from ship takeovers, or clues about star systems to explore.

Connecting the two:
- **Economy & Strategy**: Success in Spherepop can influence a player's status and capability in Haplopraxis. For example, collecting a significant amount of boronium from bubbles might allow players to fortify their ship against takeovers.
- **Player Interactions**: When a player is engaging in Spherepop, others might have the opportunity to contest control over the high-value bubbles, leading to direct player-vs-player competitions.

Both Haplopraxis and Spherepop, when integrated seamlessly, can offer players a multifaceted experience. While Haplopraxis offers exploration, strategy, and player interaction, Spherepop can provide a quicker, action-packed diversion with direct implications on the main game.
