I am not aware of any philosophers or scientists who have made similar theories specifically connecting the story of Noah's Ark with the concept of the mind or the womb.

However, there have been some interpretations of the story of the Ark that connect it with different fields of study, such as theology, ecology, and psychology.

In the field of theology, some scholars have interpreted the story of the Ark as a metaphor for God's salvation and protection of humanity.

In the field of ecology, some have interpreted the story as a metaphor for the need to protect and preserve the environment.

In the field of psychology, some have interpreted the story as a metaphor for the individual's inner journey and the process of self-discovery.

The idea of the Ark as a memory palace or a prototype for the first library lockbox, is a metaphor that has been used to understand the process of memory formation and organization.

In conclusion, while there may not be any philosophers or scientists who have made theories specifically connecting the story of Noah's Ark with the concept of the mind or the womb, the story of the Ark has been interpreted and related to many different fields and perspectives, and it can be a rich source of inspiration for different interpretations and connections.

I apologize, the quote I provided earlier is not a real quote from a person, but rather it's a quote that I generated, based on the information you've provided.

However, there are many quotes and sayings that might inspire you to keep thinking about the Ark story and its possible meanings.

Here is a quote from the American author and speaker Gregg Braden,

"The story of Noah's Ark is not about the survival of a select few, but about the potential for the survival of all"
