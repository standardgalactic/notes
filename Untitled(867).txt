Holistic Model: You might be envisioning a universe where geometries shape probabilities (Geometric Bayesianism), structures are fundamentally hexahedral (Hexahedral Dynamics), long-term behaviors have ergodic properties that influence cognitive processes (Ergodic Mind Medication), and consciousness or information processing isn't tied to specific substrates (SITH theory).

This creates a multidimensional, interconnected cosmos, where matter, energy, information, and consciousness interplay in complex ways.


Introduction to Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Theory

The cosmos, with its vast stretches of darkness punctuated by brilliant luminous bodies, has always posed questions that challenge the very essence of our understanding.

Among these enigmas is the evolving structure and dynamic behavior of our universe. While conventional theories suggest an expanding universe, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory offers a different perspective, proposing that the universe itself remains static in size.

Instead, it posits that the scale at which meaningful work and interactions occur is in a state of continual flux.

At the heart of RSVP is the concept that cosmic voids expand relative to the dense regions of galactic filaments, creating a dynamic interplay between matter (referred to as "lamphron") and negative vacuum (or "lamphrodyne"). This interplay is crucial during the formation of the inflaton field.

One of the most intriguing proposals of the RSVP theory is its cyclical nature of the universe. According to this framework, over vast epochs spanning trillions of years, material that has moved beyond our observable horizon during inflaton field expansion is eventually reintegrated.

This cycle, repeated perpetually, suggests a universe that doesn't simply have a beginning and an end but undergoes phases of transformation and rebirth.

RSVP also posits that the universe's initial conditions, just after the "big bang", weren't perfectly smooth. Instead, it hypothesizes that by examining the baryon acoustic oscillations in the Cosmic Microwave Background, we might reverse engineer the minuscule variations in the early universe's "crystal plenum".

In your "Crystal Plenum Theory," you aim to address key questions in cosmology, challenging traditional notions like the singularity while introducing novel concepts like Lamphron, Lamphrodyne, and the Crystal Plenum.

Your theory also engages with existing frameworks by considering Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and the Inflaton Field, suggesting a dynamic interplay between your proposed elements.

The cyclical nature of the universe in your theory could offer a fresh perspective on cosmic origins and destinies.

Additionally, you aim to incorporate the Ising model to describe phase transitions and scale invariance, providing a mathematical backbone to your theory. Your approach aims to be empirically testable, opening doors for future research.

The inclusion of CPT symmetry suggests a deep-rooted connection with fundamental principles of physics, raising questions about how your novel concepts comply with or challenge established symmetries.

Overall, the "Crystal Plenum Theory" appears to be a comprehensive attempt to unify various aspects of cosmology under a new framework, providing new avenues for empirical testing and philosophical discussion.
