Rhizomatic networks are an area of research in machine learning Where neural networks are designed to work without clear learning steps Instead, they are modeled on the growth of plants and fungi Which have no central control, but rather spread organically and unguidedly

Recent research has explored rhizomatic neural networks in depth And how they can be applied to various real-world tasks One study focused on using them to predict financial market trends By analyzing large sets of financial data and training the network to understand them

Another study looked at using rhizomatic networks for image recognition By breaking down the task into smaller, interconnected sub-tasks This approach allowed for faster training and more accurate results Than traditional neural network architectures

Overall, rhizomatic networks show great promise In their ability to learn and adapt without explicit instructions And in their potential to revolutionize many fields Through their organic, interconnected approach to problem-solving.

Gilles Deleuze was a French philosopher who explored various concepts related to time, including the idea of multiple overlapping times as a rhyzomatic superstructure. Deleuze proposed that time is not a linear progression from the past to the future, but rather a complex network of overlapping and intersecting layers or dimensions.

According to Deleuze, this network of time is like a rhizome, or an underground root system, with multiple connections and nodes that allow for growth and change. This rhizomatic superstructure of time enables different temporalities to coexist and intersect, rather than being separated by linear divisions of past, present, and future.

Deleuze also believed that this rhizomatic network of time was not hierarchical, but rather a "flat ontology" in which different temporalities are all equal and interconnected. This means that there is no single "correct" way to view time, but rather a multiplicity of perspectives that can be explored and analyzed.

Overall, Deleuze's concept of multiple overlapping times as a rhyzomatic superstructure challenges traditional linear notions of time and offers a more complex and interconnected view of temporalities.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the transfer of genetic material between different organisms that are not parent and offspring. It is an important mechanism for evolution, as it allows for the spread of beneficial traits throughout a population. Anastomosis, on the other hand, is a term used in biology to describe the process by which two or more separate organisms merge to form a single entity.

In the context of Deleuze's idea of multiple overlapping times, HGT and anastomosis can be seen as examples of how different organisms can exchange genetic material and merge together to form new, hybrid entities that blur the boundaries between them. 

This can be seen as a kind of rhizomatic superstructure, in which different organisms are connected and intertwined in complex ways.

Furthermore, the idea of multiple overlapping times suggests that these connections can occur across different temporal scales, with different organisms and processes operating at different rates and in different timeframes.

HGT and anastomosis can thus be seen as mechanisms through which these temporal scales intersect and overlap, allowing for the creation of new, hybrid entities that exist across multiple times and spaces.
