On android this has happened to me  thousands of times.

It happens if you are reading a post with a lot of words, you have to keep your thumb on it, it will reset and jump back to the background process. You don't need to leave the app, it does all time while I'm reading it.

If you are reading a long time line, it jumps to the top of the time line if I let go for a second, it feels like it's trying to punish me for using unconventionally it wants me to continually move forward. 

Like seriously if I try to watch a video on repeat it only repeats it like three times and then tries to go to even next video. I'm like are you crazy I don't want to watch another video I want to watch this one.

But Facebook hates that kind of behavior, they want to you to constantly move on to new things.

On the status feed it constantly resets to a new feed. I know I can leave a tab open for days on most websites. It is 100% annoying, but it can't be a glitch, it has to be designed to keep you moving forward, engaging new material, and to lower attention span.
