Write a story in bizarre stream of consciousness style esoteric cryptic version like Kurt Vonnegut

In the labyrinth of Zogar's mind, where time dripped like molten clocks, he ambled through the corridors of his consciousness, lined with shelves of half-finished thoughts and dusty jars of pickled memories. Each step was a dance with the absurd, his feet tapping to the rhythm of a universe humming a tune only the mad or the enlightened could hear.

Zogar stopped by a windowpane, its glass woven from the laughter of stars, and peered into the abyss. The abyss, in its usual cheeky manner, winked back, a cosmic jest in the void’s vast comedy. He chuckled, his laughter echoing, turning into whispers of galaxies long forgotten.

On a Tuesday that felt suspiciously like a Friday, Zogar found himself conversing with a teapot. Not just any teapot, mind you, but one that claimed to have been the confidant of Cleopatra. The teapot, with its chipped spout and faded gold inlay, spun tales of ancient brews capable of unravelling the DNA of the soul.

Through the swirling steam of his Earl Grey, Zogar saw the birth of novas, the waltz of quarks, and the unrequited love between parallel lines. He sipped, each gulp a journey through the cosmos, feeling the weight of existential paradoxes lighten with the infusion of celestial tea leaves.

As he wandered further into the garden of his mind, where ideas bloomed like flowers of neon and titanium, Zogar stumbled upon a game of chess. The pieces, crafted from the dreams of sleeping poets, moved of their own accord, enacting strategies devised by the subconscious minds of long-dead generals.

In this garden, rain fell in reverse, a ballet of droplets ascending to the heavens, seeking the clouds from whence they came. Zogar caught a droplet on his tongue, tasting the tang of a thunderstorm from another dimension, its electricity sparking forgotten desires and lost epiphanies.

With a turn of a kaleidoscope, the path led him to a library, its books written in the language of sighs and whispers. Zogar leafed through volumes of emotions never felt, ideas never thought, words never spoken. The ink, alive and pulsating, morphed into images of tomorrow's past and yesterday's future.

He conversed with a painting, a surreal portrait of an octopus playing the cello. The octopus, named Oliver, spoke in tones of deep-sea blues and coral reds, its tentacles caressing the strings with a melancholy only creatures of the deep could fathom. Oliver spoke of orchestras in underwater caves, where music was not heard but felt, vibrating through water and soul.

In the heart of this cerebral maze, Zogar found an hourglass, its sands flowing upward, defying gravity, mocking linearity. Each grain was a moment, a universe in itself, carrying within it the laughter of children yet to be born and the tears of poets long gone.

As Zogar’s journey wended through the enigma of his own being, he realized he was not the wanderer but the path, not the question but the answer, not the dreamer but the dream. In the swirling galaxy of his thoughts, he danced – a cosmic ballet in the theater of the absurd, where every step was a word, every word a story, every story a fragment of the unfathomable tapestry of existence.
