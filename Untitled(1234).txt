Dualism - Perfect Foundation
Nick Dual - 2022

Philosophy answers all our questions whenscience still can't because it's the original thoughtand helps us find a path with the fewest mistakes.

In most key foundations, Dualism is the bestdevelopment of everything.

Chapter 1
Why is the book written?
Everything or every concept in linguistics becomes a better form like aliving creature after milliseconds to million years.

Philosophy hasn't been
developing well by suppression from some conservatives in politics and religionswho have limited knowledge and benefits from followers.

Ancient philosophers didn't have enough knowledge in linguistics,
computer science, and the other scientific fields to completely define thefoundations of philosophy.

Science is the knowledge of repeated patterns with enough data.

Philosophy is the knowledge of repeated patterns without enough data.
