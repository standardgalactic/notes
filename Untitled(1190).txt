Do you know the etymology of the word Portugal and the word orange in Arabic?

Yes, I apologize for the oversight regarding the translation.

**Portugal**:
The name "Portugal" is derived from the Latin name "Portus Cale". "Portus" is Latin for "port" or "harbor", and "Cale" (or "Cailleach") is believed to be a pre-Roman or Celtic word, referring to a settlement near the Douro river. Over time, "Portus Cale" evolved into "Portucale" and eventually became "Portugal". This region in the northwest of what is now Portugal was an early center of power from which the nation expanded.

**Orange in Arabic**:
The word for orange in Arabic is "بُرتُقال" (burtuqāl). The etymology of the Arabic term is fascinating and relates to the spread of the fruit. Oranges were introduced to Europe from Asia. In many European languages, the fruit was named after the country that was a significant early trader of the fruit, and that was Portugal. So, the Arabic word "burtuqāl" for orange directly refers to Portugal. This naming pattern is seen in some other languages as well, where the term for the orange fruit is derived from a variation of "Portugal".

I heard that the pillars of Hercules originally referred to an outlet of the Aegean sea of the black Sea and eventually moved to the mouth of the Mediterranean.

The Pillars of Hercules most commonly refer to the promontories that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar: the Rock of Gibraltar to the north (today part of the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar) and either Monte Hacho or Jebel Musa in Morocco to the south. This strategic gateway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea was considered the westernmost boundary of the known ancient world.

The association of the Pillars of Hercules with the Strait of Gibraltar can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman sources. The pillars were thought to have been set up by Hercules as a monument to his completion of one of his Twelve Labours – specifically, the one where he had to fetch the Cattle of Geryon from a distant land located beyond the known world, which involved him smashing through a mountain to reach the Atlantic.

However, over time and especially before precise cartography, geographical notions and the details of myths could become altered or confused. Some ancient sources or later speculations might have shifted or conflated geographical landmarks. That being said, the most widely accepted and documented association of the Pillars of Hercules has always been with the Strait of Gibraltar.

The idea that the Pillars of Hercules might originally have referred to an outlet of the Aegean Sea or the Black Sea is not mainstream in historical scholarship. Still, it's an intriguing theory and highlights the fluidity and development of geographical and mythological concepts over time. If you've come across this idea in specific literature or theories, it might be interesting to delve deeper into those sources to understand the context and basis of such claims.

Multiple Pillars of Hercules
However, the Pillars of Hercules were not only connected with the concept of westernmost limits. As shown by Pindar’s quote, the expression came to be used to represent limits in general. Therefore, it is no surprise that the term ‘Pillars of Hercules’ was sometimes also applied to other aspects of the limits of Greek geographical knowledge.


For example, Isocrates, an Athenian writer who lived in c. 400 BC, wrote that Heracles set up some pillars to the far east of Greece. He explains that Hercules had attacked the city of Troy and then set up the Pillars of Hercules in the vicinity. Isocrates specifically states that this was ‘to mark the boundaries of the territory of the Hellenes’.

This is slightly different to representing the limits of Greek geographical *knowledge* (after all, even according to Greek mythology, the Greeks had explored further east than Troy prior to the time of Heracles, so Troy was not the limit of their geographical knowledge at that time) but it is a fairly similar concept.

Supporting this, the fourth century grammarian Servius wrote:

“For we read of the columns of Hercules both in Pontus [the Black Sea] and in Spain.”

This seems to connect the pillars with the Bosporus, the entrance to the Black Sea, not far from Troy.

Thank you for sharing that article excerpt. It sheds light on the broader context in which the term "Pillars of Hercules" was used.

This perspective suggests that the term was not strictly geographically tied to one location but could be used more conceptually to indicate boundaries or limits of knowledge, territory, or influence. This makes sense, given that myths and their associated symbols often evolve and adapt to different contexts over time.

The idea that there were "Pillars of Hercules" near Troy and the Bosporus is intriguing and speaks to the cultural and symbolic significance of Hercules in the ancient Greek world. It showcases how certain myths or symbols can be reinterpreted or reapplied in different contexts to serve different purposes. 

It's also a reminder that the ancient world had a different conceptual understanding of geography and landmarks than we do today. Their maps and geographical markers were intertwined with myths, stories, and cultural narratives, giving them layers of meaning that went beyond just physical location.

Yeah I think it is in Plato's account of Atlantis

Indeed, the concept of the "Pillars of Hercules" plays a significant role in Plato's account of Atlantis. In his dialogues, specifically "Timaeus" and "Critias," Atlantis is described as being beyond the Pillars of Hercules. 

In the story, the ancient Athenians, representing the height of virtue and civilization, were said to have repelled the Atlantean invaders who came from beyond these pillars. Plato presents the tale as an account passed down from the Egyptian priests to Solon and then to Plato's own lineage.

For most modern readers and scholars, the Pillars of Hercules are traditionally identified with the Strait of Gibraltar, the entrance to the Mediterranean from the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, many interpretations and speculations about the location of Atlantis are based on this understanding.

However, as your earlier excerpt highlighted, the "Pillars of Hercules" had varying meanings and locations over time. If taken in a different context, it could change the speculated location of Atlantis or the interpretation of the narrative itself.

It's worth noting, though, that Plato's story of Atlantis, whether fact or fiction, allegory or historical account, has been a subject of fascination, debate, and speculation for over two millennia. Different interpretations have been made based on various cultural, historical, or even pseudoscientific viewpoints.
