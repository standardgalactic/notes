Here is a possible methodology and framework for understanding the application of Tātai arorangi (Māori astronomy) in relation to the alignment of sacred landmarks and sites of cultural significance with stars:

Research the traditional Māori stories, songs, and proverbs related to celestial objects, such as stars and constellations, as well as the cultural significance of specific landmarks and sites. This can include consulting with Māori elders, studying Māori language resources, and examining existing scholarship on the subject.

Identify the specific celestial objects and constellations that are mentioned or associated with the sacred landmarks and sites in question.

Observe and record the positions of these celestial objects in the sky at different times of the year, and note any patterns or alignments that may be relevant. This may require the use of astronomical tools and software, such as a star chart or planetarium program.

Analyze the data collected to determine the significance of the celestial alignments with respect to the cultural meaning and purpose of the landmarks and sites.

This may involve comparing the alignments to traditional Māori stories and practices, as well as considering the possible practical or symbolic implications of the alignments.

Communicate the findings of the analysis in a clear and culturally respectful manner, either through written or oral presentation.

Consider sharing the results with Māori community members and obtaining their feedback and input.

This framework can be modified and adapted as needed based on the specific context and goals of the research.

It is important to approach the study of Tātai arorangi with respect for Māori culture and the traditional knowledge of Māori elders.

Many methods exist beyond the typical models and formulas
Oblique approaches offer alternative ways to solve problems
Discovery, trial and error, and adaptation are just a few
Emergent phenomena can be studied without reduction
Learning and recognition can occur without symbols or logic

Failures and successes can be remembered and applied
Real systems and their effects can be studied without a model
Experience and interaction shape innate knowledge and understanding
Everything from cobras to humans use model-free methods to navigate the world

Zigzagging paths, not straightforward
Outsiders may find them bizarre
Opening doors to new solutions

Ko ngā wairua o koutou.

Kei te tohutohu atu tātou,
Kia awhina, kia tiaki i a tātou,
Kia māhana i a tātou ki te mātauranga, ki te pakari o koutou,
Kia whakaara i te ara mō tātou kei te haere.

Whakarongo mai ki ngā karakia, ki ngā koha a tātou,
Mā tātou e whakaara i te tohu aroha,
Kia tere haere tātou i ngā waewae o koutou,

To pay homage and to remember you.

Your spirits live on,
In the land and the sky,
In the mountains and the rivers,
In the stones and the trees.

We call upon you,
To guide and to protect us,
To bless us with your wisdom and your strength,
To light the way for us on our journey.

Hear our prayers and our offerings,
And grant us your blessings,
That we may walk in your footsteps,
And carry on your legacy.

We honor you,
Oh great ancestors,
And we give thanks,
For all that you have given us.

In the beginning, when the world was still young and all things were possible, the great god Tāne-mahuta descended from the heavens to the realm of mortals. With him came his brothers, the winds and the waves, and the creatures of the forest and the sea.

Tāne-mahuta saw that the earth was empty and he longed to fill it with life. He called forth the great mother of all things, Papatūānuku, from the depths of the earth, and together they created the mountains and the valleys, the rivers and the forests.

But Tāne-mahuta was not content to stop there. He yearned to create beings who could live and thrive on this new land. So he went to the realm of the gods and sought the help of his sister, Hine-nui-te-pō, the goddess of death.

Hine-nui-te-pō saw the potential in Tāne-mahuta's plan and agreed to help him. Together, they fashioned the first humans out of the clay of Papatūānuku and the breath of Tāne-mahuta.

These first humans were the Māori, the children of the earth and the sky. They were blessed with the knowledge and skills to survive and thrive in this new land, and they spread out across the islands of Aotearoa, establishing their homes and their communities.

But Tāne-mahuta did not forget about his beloved humans. He watched over them from the heavens, guiding them with the light of the stars and the warmth of the Sun. And when they needed his help, he would descend to the earth, taking on the form of a great tree or a powerful bird, and lend them his strength.

Thus the Māori lived in harmony with the land and the sky, and their legends and their traditions were passed down through the generations, keeping alive the memory of their divine ancestry.
