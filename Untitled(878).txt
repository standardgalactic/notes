I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that "syngonia" is not a common English term in the context of crystallography. Upon further research, it appears that "syngony" is a term used in crystallography to refer to a type of symmetry element, specifically a symmetry element that relates two crystal faces that are not parallel

It is related to the concept of "morphotropy", which refers to the tendency of crystals to exhibit similar forms or shapes despite having different chemical compositions.

Interesting. I did not know that. I don't see a page on it on wikipedia.

Yes, it seems that "syngonia" is not a commonly used term in English, particularly in the context of crystallography. It may be more specific to the Russian language or have limited usage in scientific literature.
