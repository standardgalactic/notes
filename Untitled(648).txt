    — Hoph. - הֻכְפַּן was starved. [Aram. כְּפַן, כְּפֵן, Syr. כְּפֵן (= was hungry), Arab. kafana (= he wrapped a corpse in a shroud). For sense development cp. Aram. טְוָה, Syr. טֽוָא (= he wrapped up, span, was hungry, suffered hunger), Arab. tawa (= he folded, wrapped up, enveloped, buried), tawiya (= was hungry, suffered hunger). cp. also Eng. starve, which unites the meanings ‘to suffer from hunger’ and ‘to die from lack of food’, and its Ger. equivalent sterben (= to die).] Derivatives: כָּפוּן, כָּפָן. 

כָּפָן m.n. hunger, famine (occurring only Job 5:22 and 30:3). [From כפן ᴵᴵ. Prob. an Aramaism.]

כְּפָפָה f.n. NH glove. [Coined by Eliezer ben Yehudah (1858–1922) as a dimin. of כַּף (= hand). For the ending see first suff. ◌ָה.] 

כפר ᴵ to atone for, make atonement, expiate. 
    — Pi. - כִּפֵּר he atoned, made atonement, expiated, pacified, propitiated, forgave; 2 he made void. 
    — Pu. - כֻּפַּר 1 was atoned for, was expiated, was forgiven; 2 was made void. 
    — Nith. - נִתְכַּפֵּר, נִכַּפֵּר was atoned for, was expiated, was forgiven. [The orig. meaning prob. was ‘he covered’. It is related to Aram. כַּפֵּר (= he forgave, atoned, expiated), Arab. kafara (= he covered, hid). Some scholars connect כפר ᴵ with Akka. kapāru, kuppuru (= to wipe off; to expiate), Aram.-Syr. כְּפַר (= he washed away, wiped off). However, as shown by the Aram. verbs כְּפַר and כַּפֵּר, the meanings ‘to wash away, wipe off, cover, expiate’, are interrelated, and, accordingly, all the above words are etymologically connected. For sense development cp. Arab. ghafara (= he covered, he forgave), ‘afa (= he covered, he wiped out, he forgave).] Derivatives: כִּפּוּר, כֹּפֶר ᴵ, כַּפָּרָה, הִתְכַּפְּרוּת, מְכֻפָּר, prob. also כַּפֹּרֶת.
