Although the responses differed, it quickly became clear that as students as well as active members of society we possess many devices for both work and pleasure. Powers also delves into this topic in the very first chapter as he talks about the concept of busyness. This fits into the role of technology in our lives because one reason we are so busy is all of the technology we use. The more devices we are connected to, the busier we feel we are. Although many students feel stressed out and too busy, most admitted that some of our busyness is within our control. We have the option to be connected 24/7 and although in some ways in makes our lives more stressful, we still do it. Additionally Chapter 8, which focuses on organization, also deals with the role of the specific technology that is in our lives. Although most of the students in our class are of a younger generation than Powers, most of us agreed with his low-tech organization methods.
