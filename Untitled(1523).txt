The story that unfolded
after that morning did not
have a triumphant conclu-
sion. Several molecules isolated-scotophobin
were being the best known-that
were alleged to have behav-
ioral effects. Other peptides
were shown to be neuroac-
tive beyond the shadow of a
doubt.

And I did go on to
have a modestly successful
and rewarding career in
science. But scotophobin's
discoverer, Georges Ungar,
died in greater ignominy
and less honor than his
considerable
accomplishments warranted.

Scotophobin was discred-
ited but never fully ex-
plained. And those of us
who worked even briefly on
the disreputable notion of
biochemical transfer
memory found it a ride we
would never forget.
