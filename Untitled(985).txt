Counterfoil choice is a decision-making concept used in the Kalabari culture as a way to maintain their cultural identity and way of life while minimizing the influence of outside forces. It involves presenting two options, but only one of them is the preferred choice, while the other is only presented as a contrast or counterfoil.
