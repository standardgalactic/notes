Hello. I saw that you were interested in generative ai. I use stable diffusion for images, mac say for audiobooks, and chatgpt for brainstorming, writing essays, and tutoring me in programming languages.

Haven't figured out how to make money with it yet, but I'm working on getting it to design a recycling plant and getting it to work on a video game. In a few years it will be very good at writing code and making movies, so I'm also getting it to work on dialogues and plot ideas for sci fi stories.

A few of my "epistemological experiments"
