Well that sucks. I hit 180,000 pages on my wikipedia watchlist. Now I can't edit my raw watchlist, because the server times out at 60 seconds. I should have uploaded a copy I think before I got there. I might be 20,000 over the limit. I will check again for a few days, but I wanted to get it to 200,000 before moving ahead with Haplopraxis. Maybe if I wait few days it will fix it, or maybe it would be years before their servers are faster. I might have hit a hidden limit.

I can also reduce the size of it but it is much more difficult to remove pages, at least psychologically. I removed ngc but it is unclear how I can fix this without lowering my watch list size. I could do something like remove all As or Zs for example. I was thinking of only keeping a hundred thousand in there at a time. I could clear the watchlist maybe. But then I lose the last few days work.

I am impatient, I am hitting clear watchlist, and then will see if 150,000 is more manageable.

I have 155934 pages already but I want a round number. Part of me think 150,000 or 160,000 would be nice. 144,000 would be good as well as it is a significant number.

Ok it looks like I saved 174613 pages, so maybe I should go for 175,000 and see if that crashes it or not.

Maybe 174 thousand is too big as w well, if it is, I will have to clear it again, what a pain. Will see.

Cleared. No idea if I can add them back in, hopefully it doesn't time out, oops it crashed but it is still loading, I am at 101,000 now.

115,750 works in the raw watchlist.

Ok now I am at 128,000.

158000
174,564 but the raw won't work.

I'm clearing it again, and then going to add it back in without the "categories" I think I had 30,000 categories. I think it's like 142,000.

I am pretty sure 150,000 pages will work, if I haven't screwed it up. It takes a long time to clear the watchlist maybe a half hour to an hour.

It should work. I will then be able to remove controversial or gross pages and add interesting ones. I really hope 150,000 works, if not, 144,000 might work, qpbut I really would preferio 150,000. I might be able to get itto  working within an hour or two. 

But it seems to be taking longer this time.

116,000
