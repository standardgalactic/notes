A charcoal sketch of a robot wearing a blindfold and operating a computer. 

The robot has a sleek, modern design with a humanoid shape. It is seated in front of a desktop computer, with its metallic hands on the keyboard and mouse.

The blindfold is made of cloth, contrasting with the robot's shiny, metallic surface.

The sketch style should capture the textures of the robot's metal body and the soft fabric of the blindfold, with attention to the play of light and shadows to enhance the dramatic effect.
