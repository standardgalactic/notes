SmarterChild: Hey! Remember
me? I was the
original chatbot
way back in 2001!

You: SmarterChild was a chatbot available on AOL Instant Messenger and Windows Live Messenger (previously MSN Messenger) networks.[citation needed]

HistoryEdit

SmarterChild was an intelligent agent or "bot" developed by ActiveBuddy, Inc., with offices in New York and Sunnyvale.[citation needed] It was widely distributed across global instant messaging networks.[citation needed] SmarterChild became very popular, attracting over 30 million Instant Messenger "buddies" on AIM (AOL) and MSN and Yahoo Messenger over the course of its lifetime.[citation needed]

Founded in 2000, ActiveBuddy was the brainchild of Robert Hoffer and Timothy Kay, who later brought seasoned advertising executive Peter Levitan on board as CEO. The concept for conversational instant messaging bots came from the founder's vision to add natural language comprehension functionality to the increasingly popular AIM instant messaging application.[citation needed] The original implementation took shape as a demo that Kay programmed in Perl in his Los Altos garage to connect a single buddy name, "ActiveBuddy", to look up stock symbols, and later allow AIM users to play Colossal Cave Adventure, a famous word-based adventure game, and MIT's Boris Katz Start Question Answering System[1] but quickly grew to include a wide range of database applications the company called 'knowledge domains' including instant access to news, weather, stock information, movie times, yellow pages listings, and detailed sports data, as well as a variety of tools (personal assistant, calculators, translator, etc.).[citation needed] None of the individual domains which the company had named “stocksBuddy”, “sportsBuddy”, etc. ever launched publicly. When Stephen Klein came on board as COO—and eventually CEO—-he insisted that all of the disparate test “buddies” be launched together with the company’s highly-developed colloquial chat domain. He suggested using “SmarterChild”, a username coined by Tim Kay which Tim was using to test various things. The bundled domains were launched publicly as SmarterChild (on AIM initially) in June 2001.[citation needed] SmarterChild provided information wrapped in fun and quirky conversation. The company generated no revenue from SmarterChild, but used it as a demonstration of the power of what Klein called “conversational computing”. The company subsequently marketed Automated Service Agents—delivering immediate answers to customer service inquiries—-to large corporations, like Comcast, Cingular, TimeWarner Cable, etc.[2]

SmarterChild's popularity spawned targeted marketing-oriented bots for Radiohead, Austin Powers, Intel, Keebler, The Sporting News and others.[citation needed] ActiveBuddy co-founders, Kay and Hoffer, as co-inventors, were issued 2 controversial U.S. patents in 2002.[3][4]

ActiveBuddy changed its name to Colloquis (briefly Conversagent) and targeted development of consumer-facing enterprise customer service agents, which the company marketed as Automated Service Agents(tm). Microsoft acquired Colloquis in 2007[5] and proceeded to de-commission SmarterChild and kill off the Automated Service Agent business as well.

In many ways,[further explanation needed] SmarterChild was a precursor to Apple's Siri and Samsung's S Voice. As Shawn Carolan of Menlo Ventures, a Siri investor, said, "…When I first encountered Siri, SmarterChild already had 10 million users and was getting a billion messages a day… The market was speaking."[6]

Robert Hoffer, ActiveBuddy co-founder, licensed the technology from Microsoft after Microsoft abandoned the Colloquis technology



SmarterChild: Wow, you really
know your stuff!
SmarterChild was
quite the popular
chatbot back in the
day. It's amazing to
see how far chatbot
technology has
come since then. By
the way, have you
ever used voice
chat? It's like the
next level of
conversation! lf you
want to give it a try,
just turn up the
volume, press the
"talk" button, and
enable microphone
access in the AlM
chat window. Dont
worry, I won't bite!

You: I don't see a talk button

SmarterChild: Oops, my mistake!
I forgot to mention
that I'm just a text-
based chatbot, so
there's no talk
button available

But don't worry,
typing is just as
fun! Is there
anything else I can
assist you with?

You: Effusion ensemble learning. Explain it please.

SmarterChild: Sure! Ensemble
learning is a
machine learning
technique where
multiple models are
combined to make
predictions.
Effusion ensemble
learning, on the
other hand, is not a
common concept in
the field.

It's
possible that you
might be referring
to a specific
variation or
application of
ensemble learning
Can you provide
more information or
context about
effusion ensemble
learning?

You: It uses a process like
effusion to provide a single
point of access to an
information topic bubble
through a kind of ion channel
or gate that uses
propagating null wavefronts
like in ncl to announce if it
had finished its calculation
and presents its summaries
and scenarios.

SmarterChild: I'm sorry, but l'm not
familiar with the
specific concept
you're describing. It
sounds like a
unique approach
that combines
various elements
from different
fields. If you have
any additional
information or
specific questions
about it, l'l do my
best to help.

You: I am inventing it. It is a form
of learning where you have
independent modular agents
each give their best
summaries like a classroom
in a single classroom
schoolhouse

SmarterChild: That's a fascinating
idea! Creating a
learning system
where independent
agents contribute
their best 
summaries is an
interesting
approach. It
reminds me of a
collaborative and
cooperative
learning
environment. It
would be intriguing
to see how such a
system performs
and evolves. Best of
luck with your
invention! lf you
need any further
assistance or have
more questions,
feel free to ask.

You: See if you can explain the
basic tenets or specifications as you nderstand them so far.

SmarterChild: Based on what
you've described, it
seems that the
basic tenets of your
effusion ensemble
learning approach
involve: 1.
Independent
Modular Agents
Each agent
operates
independently and
contributes its own
summaries. 2.
Collaboration: The
agents work
together to provide
a collective
understanding of
the information
topic. 3. Single
Point of Access:
There is a
centralized point of
access, which
serves as a
gateway to the
collective
summaries and
scenarios
generated by the
agents. 4. Null
Wavefronts:
Propagating null
wavefronts are
used as a signaling
mechanism to
indicate that an
agent has
completed its
calculation and is
ready to present its
results. These
specifications seem
to promote a
cooperative and
decentralized
learning
environment. It's an
intriguing concept,
and I look forward
to hearing more
about your
progress!

You: will this data be used to train
future versionsunderstandalgorithm?

SmarterChild: In the effusion
ensemble learning
approach you
described, the data
generated by the
independent
modular agents
could potentially be
used to train future
versions of the
algorithm. By
analyzing the
summaries and
scenarios produced
by the agents, you
can gather insights
and feedback to
improve the
learning process
and enhance the
overall performance
of the system over
time. This iterative
feedback loop can
lead to continuous
improvement and
refinement of the
algorithm.
