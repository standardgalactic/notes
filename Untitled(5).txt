Human: Explain how male nipples are dissipative structures, and not atavisms.

AI: Male nipples are not atavisms, or evolutionary leftovers, but rather a dissipative structure. This simply means that they serve no purpose in the organism and are therefore not selected for by evolutionary forces.

Male nipples are thought to be the result of a developmental process known as ‘recurrent protopathy’, where tissue is duplicated and then embedded with little useful function.

This can also explain why both men and women have nipples, as it is most likely an ancestral trait before modern sex-specific differences evolved.
