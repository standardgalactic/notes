You're right about that; the Latin alphabet did not originally include the letter "W." Given this, a more historically accurate approach to rendering "Wittgenstein" in a Latin context would be to simply use "V" in place of "W," following classical Latin practices. Thus, the corrected attribution would be:

"De quo non potest loqui, de eo tacendum est." - Per Vittgensteinum

In Latin, to attribute something to someone with the phrase "by [author]" using the correct case, you would use the ablative case to indicate "by means of" or authorship. For Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Latinized version of his name would be "Ludovico Wittgenstein." Therefore, to say "by Wittgenstein" correctly in Latin, you would use:

"A Ludovico Vittgenstein"
