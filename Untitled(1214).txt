3.1.4Previous Works 
There have been numerous pieces of work done on QET. In its introduction, the focus was on spin chains and many-body systems. 
Following this, QET has been shown to work for scalar quantum i eld theories as well as 
in quantum electrodynamics. 
The next frontier for QET was to understand how the structure of the Hilbert space 
allowed for QET, and to i nd the optimal measurement schemes for QET. Although some 
work was done using POVMâ€™s made to emulate interactions with higher dimensional Hilbert 
spaces, the optimal measurement scheme was still elusive. 

This thesis 

This is where our work in this thesis begins. We propose new measurement schemes based on generalizations of the phase estimation algorithm in order to optimize the measurement 
for QET, thus allowing for better collection of information and therby greater teleportation 
of energy.
Additionally, we provide fully coherent (POVM/PVM-free) versions of the QET, which, as was discussed in the background section, is equivalent to the LOCC version of the 
protocol. 

Some work had shown, in the case of the simplest QET model, minimal QET, that the key to a good QET measurement was the breaking of entanglement between the mea- 
surement site and the rest of the system. To begin our study of QET and entanglement 
breaking, we start with an in-depth analysis of the coherent (projective-measurement-free) 
version of the minimal QET protocol.
