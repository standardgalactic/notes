6CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we introduce a new learning paradigm called active selective prediction which uses ac- 
tivelearningtoimproveselectivepredictionunderdistributionshift. Weshowthatthisnewparadigm 
results in improved accuracy and coverage on a distributionally shifted test domain and reduces the 
need for human labeling. We also propose a novel method ASPEST using checkpoint ensemble and 
self-training with a low labeling cost. We demonstrate ASPESTâ€™s effectiveness over other baselines 
for this new problem setup on various image, text and structured datasets. Future work in this di- 
rection can investigate unsupervised hyperparameter tuning on test data, online data streaming, or 
further minimizing the labeling effort by designing time-preserving labeling interfaces.
