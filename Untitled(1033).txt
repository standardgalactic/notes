It's a really outdated model. The matter in the visible universe fits inside an area the size of an atom, but it is not the origin of the universe. The areas just a little to the left of that atom are "expanded" into the observable universe, which is inaccessible now, but it will be pouring back into this area of the universe for trillions of years, stretched into the infra-microwave.

If you can imagine a point on the cosmic microwave background, there will be a fully-formed galaxy there now, and they will see us as unformed. They will say that their galaxy hasn't moved, but that our area is flying away from them.

A galaxy on the other end of the CMB will look at the same region and think it is flying away from them at the same rate, but in the opposite direction.

And so from every angle, we will appear to be zooming away, but in a completely different direction.

The only way to explain it is that there is no actual movement of places, but the amount of space or distance between objects appears to expand. But no particular galaxy would ever say that they are flying away from a location as would be the case if it had started as an atom and expanded outwards.

Expanding universe concept.

￼￼

Could you fix my spelling and grammar? It's a really outdated model. The matter in the the visible universe fit inside an area the size of an atom, but it is not the origin of the universe, the areas just a little to that atom are "expanded" into the observable universe a little to the left, inaccessible now but it will be pouring back into this area of the universe for trillions of years, stretched into the infra-microwave. If you can imagine a point on the cosmic microwave background, it will have a fully-formed galaxy there now, and they will see us as unformed. They will say that their galaxy hasn't moved, but that our area is flying away from them A galaxy on the other end of the CMB will look at the same region and think it is flying away from them at the same rate, but in the opposite direction. And so from every angle we will appear to be zooming away, but in a completely different direction. The only way to explain it is that there is no actual movement of places, but the amount of space or distance between objects appears to expand, but no particular galaxy would ever say that they are flying away from a location as would be the case if it had started as an atom and expanded outwards.

So at one second have after the universe began "expanding" the universe would have appeared as a semi dense brick that extended in all directions, not as a tiny atom. It wasn't infinitely dense, it had the same much energy as it does does more, but it was just so smooth and evenly distributed that movement was nearly impossible. There weren't areas of greater density like protons, neutrons, and stars, surrounded by empty regions, it was just the same or almost the same density everywhere. There would have been photons forming and unforming but they could never go anywhere, because the equal distribution of matter acted like a crystal lattice or grid that prevented anything from moving out of that region. The amount of energy in the universe isn't changing and the universe as a whole is not changing in size. After 280,000 years of "expansion", energy congealed into protons, allowing for some space between them to exist, and photons were allowed to move into neighboring regions. The universe would have appeared as a fog that extended in all directions. Over hundreds of thousands of years, those protons gathered up because of electrostatic forces and gravity into rogue planets and stars, making it appear like some areas were getting denser, and opening up space around them. As gravity clumped up areas into stars and galaxies, areas with slightly less material were getting less dense, that is, they appear as expanding galactic voids. So the galaxies on the edge of the cmb did not get their energy from the region we are in, but from the local areas just around that region, areas that to us seem inaccessible. The dense areas like stars and black holes are emptying their energy into the regions around them, effectively heating up the "vacuum" areas until the universe is once again smooth and every area has the same density as every other.

Here's the corrected version:

It's a really outdated model. The matter in the visible universe fits inside an area the size of an atom, but it is not the origin of the universe.

So, after one second from when the universe began "expanding," the universe would have appeared as a semi-dense brick that extended in all directions, not as a tiny atom. It wasn't infinitely dense, it had the same much energy as it does now, but it was just so smooth and evenly distributed that movement was nearly impossible.

There weren't areas of greater density like protons, neutrons, and stars, surrounded by empty regions; it was just the same or almost the same density everywhere.

There would have been photons forming and unforming, but they could never go anywhere because the equal distribution of matter acted like a crystal lattice or grid that prevented anything from moving out of that region.

The amount of energy in the universe isn't changing, and the universe as a whole is not changing in size. After 280,000 years of "expansion," energy congealed into protons, allowing some space between them to exist, and photons were allowed to move into neighboring regions. The universe would have appeared as a fog that extended in all directions.

Over hundreds of thousands of years, those protons gathered up because of electrostatic forces and gravity into rogue planets and stars, making it appear as if some areas were getting denser, and opening up space around them.

As gravity clumped up areas into stars and galaxies, areas with slightly less material were getting less dense; that is, they appear as expanding galactic voids.

So the galaxies on the edge of the CMB did not get their energy from the region we are in but from the local areas just around that region, areas that to us seem inaccessible.

The dense areas like stars and black holes are emptying their energy into the regions around them, effectively heating up the "vacuum" areas until the
the universe is once again smooth and every area has the same density as every other.

It seems that this was proposed by Poincare in 1890.
