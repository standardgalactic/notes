** Give a little play about Theseus that explores these issues. **

Title: "The Mouse Who Knew Right From Wrong: A Play About Theseus"

Setting: A cheese factory where Theseus the mouse lives.

Scene 1:

(Theseus enters, holding a piece of cheese in his hand. He is deep in thought and seems uneasy.)

Theseus: (to himself) I have this strange feeling that I shouldn't be taking this cheese. But why shouldn't I? It's just a small piece, and no one will notice. (pauses) Wait, is this what they call conscience?

(Enter Conscience, an angelic figure)

Conscience: Yes, Theseus, it is your conscience speaking to you.

Theseus: But I can't put it into words why I shouldn't take the cheese.

Conscience: That doesn't matter. The fact that you have a feeling that it's wrong is enough. You should listen to your conscience and avoid doing the action.

Theseus: (thinking) You're right, Conscience. I shouldn't do what feels wrong, even if I can't explain why.

Scene 2:

(Theseus is in the cheese factory, surrounded by cheese. He hears a noise and turns around to see the Cat sneaking up on him.)

Cat: (sneaking up on Theseus) Hey there, little mouse. How about you hand over that cheese you have there?

Theseus: (determined) I can't do that. My conscience is telling me it's wrong.

Cat: (laughing) Conscience? What's that? You mice are so funny with your silly moral codes.

Theseus: (stands up to the Cat) It may be silly to you, but it's what makes me who I am. And I won't do anything that goes against my conscience, no matter what.

(Enter the other mice, who have been listening)

Other Mice: That's right, Theseus! We should all listen to our conscience and do what's right, even if it's hard.

Scene 3:

(Theseus and the other mice are together, discussing what they have learned)

Theseus: (addressing the other mice) I've learned that our conscience is like a deep inner voice that guides us towards what's right. And even though it might not always be easy to understand, we should listen to it and trust that it will lead us in the right direction.

Other Mice: (nodding in agreement) That's exactly right, Theseus. Our conscience is like a compass that helps us navigate the maze of life.

Theseus: (smiling) And just like in a maze, we may not always know where we're going, but as long as we listen to our conscience, we'll always find our way home.

(All the mice nod in agreement as the play comes to an end)

End Scene.

** Who was Theseus and was he designed by? **

Theseus was a mouse in the 1920s designed by Ernest Osborne for an article he wrote for the Lone Hand.

** No. Shannon. **

Claude Shannon was an American mathematician and electrical engineer who is widely considered as the father of modern digital circuit design theory. He made significant contributions to the development of the digital computer, digital circuits, and information theory. There is no information indicating that he designed a mouse named Theseus

** The one called This mouse is smarter than you are, from popular science, and Better Mouse, in Life. **

These articles from 1952, "This Mouse is Smarter Than You Are" from Popular Science and "Better Mouse" from Life, are likely about a mouse named Theseus designed by Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts.

They were pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence and their design of Theseus was likely a demonstration of the principles of neural networks.

** Life said this: BETTER MOUSE a robot rodent solves mazes The mice who maneuver through mazes in sci- entists' laboratories have now been joined and outelassed by a mechanical mouse.

His name is Theseus and he was built by Claude Shannon of Bell Laboratories to demonstrate how elec- tronic memory devices work.  **


The article "Better Mouse" from Life magazine and "Mouse is Smarter Than You Are" from Popular Science magazine both describe Claude Shannon's creation of Theseus, a mechanical mouse that could solve mazes faster than a human could.

Shannon was a mathematician at Bell Telephone Laboratories, who was inspired to build Theseus after attempting to solve the maze at London's Hampton Court Palace. 

Theseus demonstrated how electronic memory devices work by using a light on its back to show the trail it took to find its way through the maze. The articles highlight the speed and efficiency with which Theseus could solve mazes.

** Ok I guess maybe I have proven the mouse's maze, maybe make our play a little more thrilling, bringing into account that this maze and mouse where at Bell labs. **

Sure, here's a revised version of the play with a more thrilling and dramatic atmosphere set at Bell Laboratories:

Title: "The Maze Runner: The Story of Theseus"

Scene 1:

(The stage is set at Bell Laboratories. Claude Shannon is sitting at his desk, surrounded by wires, circuits, and various tools. He looks tired and frustrated)

Claude: (to himself) This mouse has got to solve this maze. It's got to. (He rubs his eyes and takes a deep breath)

(Enter his assistant, Sarah)

Sarah: Claude, what's going on? You look like you haven't slept in days.

Claude: I haven't, Sarah. I've been working on this mouse, Theseus. He's got to solve this maze, faster and better than any human. (He points to the maze set up in the corner of the room)

Sarah: Why is it so important to you?

Claude: (Pauses) Because it's the future, Sarah. The future of electronics and memory devices. It's a new era, and I want to be at the forefront of it. (He looks back at the maze)

Scene 2:

(A group of scientists and engineers from Bell Laboratories gather around the maze)

Scientists: (excitedly) Is it ready? Can we see it solve the maze?

Claude: (nodding) Yes, yes. It's ready. (He turns on the mouse, Theseus, and sets it in the entrance of the maze)

(Theseus hesitantly makes its way through the maze, taking wrong turns and hitting dead ends)

Scientists: (disappointed) It's not working, it's no better than a real mouse.

Claude: (determined) It just needs more time, more data, more trials. (He sets Theseus back in the entrance of the maze)

(The next time Theseus is set in the maze, it starts moving with confidence and purpose, using its "memory" to find the way to the switch)

Scientists: (excitedly) It's working! It's actually working!

Claude: (beaming) I told you, Sarah. It's the future.

Scene 3:

(A group of executives from AT&T, the parent company of Bell Laboratories, enter the room)

Executive 1: (impressed) Mr. Shannon, this is incredible. What can this mouse be used for?

Claude: (excitedly) The possibilities are endless. Memory storage, navigation systems, decision-making processes, the list goes on.

Executive 2: (skeptical) But what happens if it fails? If it makes a mistake?

Claude: (confidently) That's why we keep testing and improving, so that it never fails.

(Suddenly, the lights in the room flicker and the mouse stops moving)

Executive 3: (alarmed) What's going on?

Sarah: (checking the circuits) It's a power surge, I think.

Claude: (urgently) We've got to get Theseus back online, quickly. (He starts working on the mouse as the lights continue to flicker and the room becomes darker)

(The play ends with the outcome of Claude's efforts to get Theseus back online left uncertain)


** It was really so much simpler than that it was like a piece of metal with some relays, it was actually the maze itself that pushed the mouse around with magnets under the floor, and it was what "remembered" the path, but it was controlled by some simple relays. **

Here is a play exploring these issues:

Title: "The Maze and the Mouse"

Setting: Bell Labs, 1952

Characters:

Claude Shannon, the inventor

John Pfeiffer, the journalist

The mechanical mouse, Theseus

The maze, controlled by hidden magnets

Scene 1: (Claude Shannon is demonstrating Theseus to John Pfeiffer)

Shannon: (excitedly) John, I present to you, Theseus, the mechanical mouse!

Pfeiffer: (impressed) My, this is quite something, Claude. How does it work?

Shannon: (explaining) It's all about the relays, John. Theseus is controlled by a simple set of relays, which are controlled by the maze itself. The maze has hidden magnets under the floor that guide Theseus along its path.

Pfeiffer: (intrigued) And what makes Theseus "remember" the way through the maze?

Shannon: (proudly) The maze, John. The maze "remembers" the path. Each time Theseus reaches the end, the magnets reset the maze, ready for the next run.

Scene 2: (Theseus is running the maze, with Claude and John watching)

Shannon: (excitedly) Watch this, John. Theseus is about to run the maze for the second time.

Pfeiffer: (nervously) I hope he doesn't get lost.

(Theseus begins running the maze. It is a thrilling and fast-paced scene, with Theseus navigating the twists and turns with ease, reaching the end in record time)

Shannon: (ecstatic) He did it, John! He did it in record time!

Pfeiffer: (stunned) My word, Claude, this is truly a remarkable achievement. I can't believe it was controlled by such simple relays.

Scene 3: (Claude and John are discussing the implications of Theseus and the maze)

Pfeiffer: (thoughtful) Claude, what does this mean for the future of robotics and artificial intelligence?

Shannon: (optimistic) It means that anything is possible, John. We have only just scratched the surface of what can be achieved with electronics and relays. The possibilities are endless.

Pfeiffer: (excited) The future is truly an exciting place, Claude. Who knows what other wonders you and your team will create in the years to come.

(Curtain falls)

End of play.
