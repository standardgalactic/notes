 so we will close the the

session and now we go for lunch all

together so once we close the I will

explain the details but for and and also

the little activity maybe people uh

connected online um please try to check

or select two or three concepts that

this morning were useful to you um and

so then you can share them with us I was

picking up some Concepts that were

interesting today like coincidence

backward and forward reasoning

predictive processing free

improvisations or price and equilibria

and there is this idea that I uh I I

have around that I want to explain later

or share which is the idea of nonlinear

knowledge

...

never shared with chrisan

and this surprise and equilibrium uh

which was mentioned also that the idea

that there is surprise that makes

everything fun makes everything

interesting uh or makes life I don't

know

challenging and then so something that

protect us as you were saying so so this

this rationality or this idea of

predicting is a some sort of protection

this idea I like a lot and resonates as

well with with with the things that I

will talk I will def I will basically

talk about three things so I'll try to

dedicate some five minutes to them the

first one is like the idea of nonlinear

knowledge which I've never called it

that way until today so so it's it's a

new con the second is the Triangular

inequality and the space where I might

live so that's the first the second and

the third is idea of

Life towards

intelligence and through a concept that

I call aordance which is a a concept

that exist in this in the literature

with different names but uh but I'm

trying to redevelop so I will try to

share these three things the first is

the nonlinear knowledge then okay so if

you

wanna um if we want to know the world if

you want to think when we think about

the world uh there is something really

interesting about this notion of object

that the things we know from the world

are things that are in the world so in a

in a super um realistic uh real in the

sense of realism in philosophy so in a

very realistic perspective we have a

world that we have to know and the world

is composed by objects or something that

is static something that is there to be

known so we start with this idea of

objects and things that are going to be

known okay let's assume for a moment

that the world is only composed by

objects of that kind but by things of

that kind that are completely stable so

we will know them okay if we go back to

the uh to to the description of uh

dynamical systems in in in mathematics

there is a very fun and simple

description of something that is static

in time it's is static we mean static in

time so for example let's say in very

simple terms a rock is a rock because if

you go to see The Rock today The Rock

will have this all the the molecular

structure of it will be the same

tomorrow so so it's the same it's the

rock it's the same thing okay and that

has a very simple description called in

dynamical systems a fixed point so there

are many intricacies that we can go and

discuss but basically it's very simple

to argue that a rock is a fixed point in

the dynamical system will it at so there

is this notion of fixed

point so what's the idea of a fixed

point if I look in a in a diagram for

example of motion let's think of the

motion of a ball in a table okay so this

is the x axis of the table and this is

the y axis of the table so if I see this

this table I have this x axis here Y

axis there so if I want to draw the

trajectory of this ball that is going

let's say it's a Billard table okay so I

will I will shoot it from here and then

it will do some trajectory like this

let's say I'm in the middle of the table

at the y axis and in the zero uh middle

of the table at the zero coordinate so

I'm here and I shoot shoot shoot the B

so it will reach something like this and

it will do something like that and then

something like this and it will start at

some point it will stop we don't see the

speed of it here because we are only

looking at position coordinates so it

will go up and down as the ball draws

and it will draw this

trajectory once the ball reaches the end

because of the friction the ball will at

some point will stop after that there is

nothing

else so the ball stops and it's in a

fixed point that is reached through

through this transient Dynamics okay

when we look at the at the for example

in a in a something like the typical
