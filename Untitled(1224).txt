Bitcoin is a misaligned AI. It is a paper-clip maximizer, by design. I'm not sure how this isn't completely obvious. The paper-clip is proof of work or proof of stake. I suggest instead we move to proof of stupidity.

We use real money but in order to remove it the from bank, you have to get your computer to lose 1,000,000 minesweeper games in a row. You know that this is no different than bitcoin. If you want a better banking system ban the sale and purchase of all lotteries. They are literally a tax on the poor and the uneducated.
