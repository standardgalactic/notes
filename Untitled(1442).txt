A surreal painting set on an alien planet representing the concept of a universal language. The setting is a bustling alien city with diverse alien life forms, each with a unique appearance, engaged in conversation using their own distinct keyboards. These keyboards are of various shapes, sizes, and colors, tailored to the anatomy of each alien species. The background shows a harmonious blend of futuristic architecture and alien landscapes, with large screens displaying symbols of a universal language. The painting should convey a sense of unity in diversity, with a vibrant color palette to enhance the otherworldly atmosphere.
