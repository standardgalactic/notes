**Multiscale Competency Architectures (MCAs)**

- MCA is a hierarchical arrangement where components at each scale function independently without top-down instructions.
- MCAs are key to understanding complex systems' behaviors.

**Free Energy Principle (FEP)**

- FEP is a framework explaining how systems interact with their environments.
- Systems are "competent" when they minimize the variational free energy of their environment.
- FEP involves predicting and controlling environmental influences for stability.

**Informational Symmetry and Cognitive Asymmetry**

- Informational symmetry exists in physical interactions between systems and environments.
- Cognitive asymmetry arises because systems and environments process information differently.

**Thermodynamics of Self-Organization**

- The environment plays an active role in self-organization processes.
- Self-organization is always environment-assisted.

**Predicting Future Behavior**

- No system can fully predict its own future behavior, especially in new or changing situations.

**The Frame Problem in AI and Thermodynamics**

- The separation of a system from its environment (via a Markov Blanket) limits the system's ability to fully understand or predict environmental changes.

**Learning Processes**

- Learning involves a mix of guidance and self-discovery, neither entirely passive nor fully autonomous.
- Learning processes are inherently unpredictable.

**Role of the Environment as an Agent**

- The environment actively shapes the development and behavior of systems.

**Experimental Strategy for Recombinant Biology**

- Mixing cells from different origins to observe interactions and development, akin to experimenting with diverse ingredients to create novel outcomes.

**Conclusion: Key Takeaways**

- FEP provides a universal model for MCAs in natural and engineered systems.
- The environment is an active agent in training and engineering systems.
- Self-organization is environment-assisted, reducing the VFE of the environment.
- Expanding the concept of "normal" in biology to include unconventional systems.
- The environment encodes "target morphology" actively.
- The environment behaves as a typical active inference agent.
- Suggested experimental strategy to create diverse multicellular systems.
