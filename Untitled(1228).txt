I was curious if anyone else has written about the hypothesis of swinging the arrowheads on string to make them ring in order to tune other arrowheads. When you spin two together at the same speed, there is a warble or a beat if they are not the same shape they would be out of tune with each other. This is why I titled my mini essay "Perfecting Our Instruments" as a reference to spinning poi for tuning arrowheads.

Up to my last update in January 2022, I don’t have any specific information on the hypothesis you’ve described—using swinging arrowheads on strings to produce sound for tuning other arrowheads. Your hypothesis is indeed fascinating as it suggests an intricate understanding and application of sound and resonance by early humans in the crafting and refinement of their tools.

Such a hypothesis would be based on the idea that early humans not only recognized the auditory signals of different materials and forms but also actively used this information in their crafting processes. This involves a nuanced application of acoustics and sound in prehistoric technology and craftsmanship, which is a relatively unexplored area of study.

For more accurate and updated information, you might need to look into recent publications, archaeological reports, or academic journals that specialize in prehistoric technologies, acoustics, or both. Engaging with professionals in the field, such as archaeologists, anthropologists, and acousticians who specialize in ancient or prehistoric music and sound, could also provide more insight into whether this hypothesis has been explored or documented elsewhere.

If this is an original idea, it might be worthwhile to document your hypothesis formally and seek feedback from experts in relevant fields. Engaging with the academic community could help in refining, validating, or challenging your hypothesis, contributing to the broader understanding of early human activities and technologies.

See if you can articulate it in a few different ways or wordings

Certainly! Below are a few ways to articulate your hypothesis:

### Variation 1:
"The hypothesis proposes that early humans might have employed a sophisticated technique for tuning their stone arrowheads. By suspending these arrowheads on strings and setting them into oscillation, individuals could discern subtle auditory signals or 'tunes' emanating from the stones. When two arrowheads were spun concurrently at identical speeds, any discordant sound or 'warble' between them would signify a divergence in their forms and tones. This acoustic feedback mechanism enabled early humans to fine-tune the shapes and sizes of their arrowheads, ensuring consistency and efficiency in their crafting processes."

### Variation 2:
"Could early humans have refined their crafting techniques using sound as a guide? This hypothesis suggests that swinging arrowheads on strings generated specific tones or sounds, assisting crafters in tuning and perfecting their tools. When two arrowheads oscillated together at the same rate, any auditory mismatch - a distinct warbling or beat - indicated that the arrowheads were out of tune due to shape differences. This sound-based tuning system would have helped in developing and refining tools with precision."

### Variation 3:
"The proposed hypothesis explores the possibility that early humans used a sound-based method to perfect their arrowhead crafting. By spinning arrowheads on strings, they could produce tones, which when compared, provided auditory feedback on the tuning of the arrowheads. A warble heard when two arrowheads were spun at the same speed indicated a discrepancy in their shapes, guiding crafters in refining their tools."

### Variation 4:
"Consider a scenario where early humans spun arrowheads on strings to generate sounds, utilizing the produced tones as an auditory guide for tuning and refining the shapes of their tools. The hypothesis suggests that a unique sound, or warble, produced when two arrowheads of different shapes were spun together, served as an acoustic signal for craftsmen to fine-tune their implements."

### Variation 5:
"This hypothesis explores the idea that the sound produced by swinging arrowheads on strings served as a tuning mechanism for early craftsmen. The distinct sound generated when two differently shaped arrowheads were spun together at the same speed provided acoustic feedback, guiding the refinement and tuning process of these early tools." 

Feel free to modify any of these variations to better suit your needs! Each version aims to convey the essence of your hypothesis from slightly different angles.

Ok well I guess even if my hypothesis is incorrect it might be interesting. I also wanted to mention this might be how Aztec' s discovered death whistles and other animal sounds whistles, by spinning some skulls, stones with holes, and clay artifacts the discovered some that howl or screech like animals and some that are kind of terrifying.

Your hypothesis indeed introduces a fascinating perspective, even if it ultimately turns out to be incorrect. It's not uncommon for initial ideas or hypotheses to serve as stepping stones to other discoveries, even if they don't pan out exactly as first imagined. Regarding the Aztecs, your suggestion that they might have discovered death whistles and other sound-producing artifacts through a similar process of experimentation and tuning is another interesting avenue to explore. These hypotheses can often provide new insights or lead to questions that haven't been considered before, sparking further investigation and understanding. Whether or not each individual hypothesis is confirmed, they contribute to the broader process of inquiry and discovery.
