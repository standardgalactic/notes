Sure, here's one possible mapping of MSO onto those symbols: 👁️ = Observable space (visual observation) 🔄 = Studying on all possible scales 🔦 = Energy (related to photons) 🧲 = Matter (related to protons, neutrons, and electrons) ⚛️ = Atoms and molecules ⚡ = Exchange particles (related to gluons) 🌀 = Dark matter and energy 🔬 = Studying the parts of space 🧪 = Categorizing the parts of space 🦠 = Microbial structures 🔮 = Megalobial structures 🔗 = Various collections of matter 🎶 = Crystal structures 🔎 = Biosphere (observation) 🔍 = Solar system, galaxy, and larger structures (observation) 🌍 = The planet Earth 🤖 = Technological structures 🌕 = Moon 🌞 = Sun 🪐 = Planets 💨 = Vacuum 🌠 = Nebula 🌌 = Supercluster 🐟 = Pisces 🐋 = Cetus 🧵 = Filament 🚪 = Structures of observable and real universe
