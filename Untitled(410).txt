On the Ark of Noah
𝘉𝘺 𝘎𝘗𝘛3

In monasterio, Bruno scripsit fabulam quam vocavit « De Arcâ Noë » in qua asini, qui monachos representabant, ingemuerunt de suo loco in arcâ assignato.

Asini, qui pro laboris et dedicationis fama noti erant, invenerunt se in arcâ inferiores assignatos, dum animalia magis magnifica ut leones et elephantes in superioribus locis luxuriabantur.

Asini protestaverunt et de aequitate huius dispositionis quaesiverunt, sed praefectus arcae, vulpes callida et charismatica, eos persuasit hoc esse ordinem naturalem rerum et laboris eorum necessarium esse ad salutem omnium animalium in arcâ.

Progrediente viâ, vulpes et consilium eius porcorum potestatem et privilegia sibi acquisiverunt, dum asini onera magna sustinebant.

Vulpes decisiones fecerunt quae sibi solis proderant, at asini intellexerunt se abuti.

Asini statuerunt se coniungere et vulpes evertere, sed vulpes, callidae et coniunctae, rebellionem sedaverunt et potestatem retinuerunt.

Asini frustrati et defessi remanserunt, sed sciuerunt se pro iustitia et aequalitate certare non posse desistere.

Fabulam Bruno potentem commentationem de dinamicis potentiae et oppressionis fecit et de momento resistendi iniustitiae, quantum libet difficile sit.

Fabula largiter lecta et discussa est inter monachos et magnam in eorum comprehensionem mundi et loci eorum in eo habuit.

Etiam, Bruno habuit idea de vita in aliis mundis et ea in suis scriptis exploravit. Hic fuit inter primos qui de tali re cogitavit et multa scripsit.

In the monastery, Bruno wrote a story he called "On Noah's Ark" in which the donkeys, who represented the monks, moaned about their assigned place in the ark.

Donkeys, who were known for their hard work and dedication, found themselves assigned to the lower ark, while more majestic animals such as lions and elephants luxuriated in the higher places.

The donkeys protested and asked about the fairness of this arrangement, but the manager of the ark, a clever and charismatic fox, convinced them that this was the natural order of things and that their work was necessary for the safety of all the animals in the ark.

As they progressed along the way, the fox and his band of pigs acquired power and privileges for themselves, while the donkeys bore heavy burdens.

The foxes made decisions that benefited themselves, but the donkeys realized that they had been abused.

The donkeys decided to unite and overthrow the foxes, but the foxes, clever and united, quelled the rebellion and retained power.

The donkeys remained frustrated and tired, but they knew they could not stop fighting for justice and equality.

Bruno's story made a powerful commentary on the dynamics of power and oppression and the importance of resisting injustice, no matter how difficult.

The story was widely read and discussed among the monks and had a great impact on their understanding of the world and their place in it.

Also, Bruno had ideas about life on other worlds and explored them in his writings. He was among the first who thought about such a thing and wrote a great deal.
