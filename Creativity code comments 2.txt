The Creativity Code: How AI Is Learning to Write, Paint and Think

by 

Marcus du Sautoy

The award-winning author of The Music of the Primes explores the future of creativity and how machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be human.

Can a well-programmed machine do anything a human can―only better? Complex algorithms are choosing our music, picking our partners, and driving our investments. They can navigate more data than a doctor or lawyer and act with greater precision. For many years we’ve taken solace in the notion that they can’t create. But now that algorithms can learn and adapt, does the future of creativity belong to machines, too?

It is hard to imagine a better guide to the bewildering world of artificial intelligence than Marcus du Sautoy, a celebrated Oxford mathematician whose work on symmetry in the ninth dimension has taken him to the vertiginous edge of mathematical understanding. In The Creativity Code he considers what machine learning means for the future of creativity. The Pollockizer can produce drip paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock, Botnik spins off fanciful (if improbable) scenes inspired by J. K. Rowling, and the music-composing algorithm Emmy managed to fool a panel of Bach experts. But do these programs just mimic, or do they have what it takes to create? Du Sautoy argues that to answer this question, we need to understand how the algorithms that drive them work―and this brings him back to his own subject of mathematics, with its puzzles, constraints, and enticing possibilities.

While most recent books on AI focus on the future of work, The Creativity Code moves us to the forefront of creative new technologies and offers a more positive and unexpected vision of our future cohabitation with machines. It challenges us to reconsider what it means to be human―and to crack the creativity code. (less)

Jun 12, 2019Jim Mccormick rated it it was amazing

Very well done. Excellent review of recent applications of AI in traditional domains of human creativity. Builds slowly to include cultural embodiment of cognition, but he does get it. Interesting conclusion that AI might improve human creativity hints at the broader aspects of coevolution that may produce the most rapid changes in society and technology. I found his treatment of the evolution of the human practice of mathematics with new technology is most interesting, but it's hard to appreciate the significance of advances in number theory and symmetry groups. 'It's easy to come up with novel theorems, but recognizing interesting theorems is a different matter.'

I thought his treatment of large data sets in the recent progress of AI was superficial and masks a lot of important detail. The three types of creativity also seemed flat - they muddle psychology, sociology, logic, and neuroscience views. He seems to recognize that transformative creativity may simply be the result of unconscious exploratory and combinational processes, which could as well be done by a machine, given tight enough interfaces.

The breadth and vivid detail of his narrative combined with his clear theoretical framework really does pave the way for much deeper insights. (less)

Can an algorithm be creative? Maybe. Can I be considered creative if I follow a formula? Absolutely! I’ve never created anything that didn’t have at least a loose program at its core and the creative people who’ve inspired me most (Karl Gerstner, Muriel Cooper, Christopher Alexander, Bob Dylan...) followed their own formulas. But for a creative work to go beyond novelty, it needs to contribute something new to its domain or open new ones. For it to be adopted by an established field and imitated by its practitioners, it has to inspire them. An AI can work within a domain and imitate its best works but before we consider it capital C Creative, it needs to illuminate paths we can’t see down without it. If it burns through all the possibilities in that direction faster than a human could, what incentive does it leave others to follow? The examples cited in Creativity Code range from toy chatbots, art counterfeiting and poem generating AIs to Go and Jeopardy champion algorithms owned by IBM and Google, worth billions. None of them are creative. If creativity is a human asserting “I am not a machine”, an AI will never be creative. But for those of us who realize their potential and learn to speak their language, they can help us be more creative than we could ever be on our own. (less)

First off, I do not come from a background of math or science. But I am inclined to the world of logic and numbers and the beauty of it all.
Marcus du Sautoy's books bring together the amazing world of numbers and number theory to everything from nature to art to technology and even sociology and history. And that's why his work is so pertinent.

In Creativity Code, he goes beyond the question of 'What is AI capable of' and 'Should we be scared of the possibilities of AI'. He dives beyond these questions, taking them from granted almost, and without any inhibitions, he explores the creative capability of AI and machine learning and such.
Without giving too much away, for me the only drawback would be that the subject matter might seem a little difficult to comprehend for those diving into the world of numbers through literature for the first time. But with Google handy, you won't be able to put the book down for sure!

Shelves: in-the-library

The author takes you iba journey of discovery of where different concepts of AI are coming from and where were are today.

It’s a recommended and interesting read for those looking into the limitations and understatements for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

While tapping on different kinds of Art and challenges it will amaze you of the complexity of the topics and how much it has been created already as the combination between humans and machines. We’ve let machines recreate outstanding art pieces, create novel songs that would deceive people on who created what and much more.

While it’s not a book that will teach you about how to create a Machine Learning model or all the kinds there are is a exploratory read about how creativity can be fostered by the use of computers and how far we might be from creative or artist machines.

One of the best parts or surprises comes at the end that make you reflex on the whole book with a different perspective. (less)

Oct 19, 2019Jesse Balster rated it really liked it

The author present a clear vision of what he thinks is required for true creativity, and how AI currently is lacking in that department. He does this by giving a framework for different kinds of creativity and going through some examples of AI and the kinds of creativity that they exhibit. Even if you know some of the examples, du Sautoy writes very compact so it isn't annoying.

An extra dimension is added through the work experience of Marcus du Sautoy in the field of mathematics. His discipline is a perfect example because proofs require the kind of creativity that we would typically call human. AI might be able to generate a bunch of new proofs, but there is no method yet to tell which ones are worth looking at. Du Sautoy argues that this might require a rooting in reality, something that can be achieved through consciousness.

I found the book very engaging at the beginning...I am not into mathematics as a "reading topic"but one of the bloggers that I follow suggested this book and I said why not?
I think the author did a great job explaining how AI is having a close approach to creativity and it addresses many topics in which AI is currently playing a role, such as the creation of music, art, cracking games, etc.
I can't say that I loved the book,actually at some point I had to skip few paragraphs because the explanations were too dense for someone that is not really a mathematician but overall Marcus did his best to explain his ideas even to someone like me that has zero background in these topics.
If you're curious about AI and you already know some of what is currently being done, I'm sure you'll find this book useful and it will leave questioning yourself about AI and its impact in humanity.

If you want to read a book about computer art you will be probably disappointed. It's basically a collection of anecdotes weaved by a mathematician. Each one is interesting and entertaining, but it has huge holes in some parts (like describing a matchmaking algorithm in context of dating apps when in fact almost no dating app uses this).

Unfortunately he's not a machine learning or art expert and it shows - also he's prone to naive generalizations, and most of actual AI problems he presents is in form of thought experiments like Turing test or Chinese room argument. If you know anything on the topic most of this will be familiar, and apart from several comments on painting or novel writing by AI you will hardly learn anything.

Disclaimer: I work with machine learning and wanted to learn about AI painters/writers (less)

Sep 01, 2020Victoria rated it liked it  ·  review of another edition

An interesting read on AI and how AI is being used in more, traditional creative domains such as music and literature.

I enjoyed this tour through the latest AI achievements. It covers plenty of ground albeit in generalist prose so no maths it computing knowledge is required. From the familiar stories of computers winning in Go and Chess through to the unfamiliar of computers generating music in the style of Bach or generating poetry.

The book really got going when du Sautoy started to explore creativity and to reveal his own concerns that AI would replace him in his role as a mathematician. This is where his musing became more interesting as he explored creative occupations including AI that is being used to generate mathematical proofs.

I would recommend this generalist AI book to anyone with an interest in AI and in particular to it's use in more creative domains. The relationship AI has with creativity isn't often explored so it was fascinating to read this exposition. (less)

Oct 08, 2021Tabish Khan rated it liked it

This well written book wrestles with something that's always fascinated me, can AI truly be creative. Du Sautoy takes us through the different art forms and some worked better for me than others - largely driven by interest so I found art and chess more interesting than classical music.

It doesn't really have an answer to the question as we are in the early stages of AI but it does set it up so we know what to look out for when the leap is made - and it definitely feels more like when rather than if.

The author does go down the route of mathematical proofs a fair bit, he is a mathematician after all, but on those parts he lost me at points. Overall I still enjoyed this thoughtful book that does a good job of highlighting the leading edge of AI and creativity. (less)

Jul 22, 2022Wallace Kaufman rated it really liked it

Sautoy is a mathematician but also has a hand in composition of music and obviously, in writing. Will AI take over his job and if so when? How good can AI become at the creative arts--poetry, fiction, music, and, of course, math since math to Sautoy is an art, a way of telling a story? Since conclusions must be earned by both writer and reader, I say only that he has a convincing conclusion and that he earns it by narrating the story of AI's development and distinguishing it from mere number crunching. I give the book 4 starts instead of 5 because at times he goes too far into the weeds of math and coding, at least for this reader. Let not that deter you from a book that will bring you nearly up to date on the achievements and potentials of AI. (less)

This was a fascinating, informative and engaging book.
I'm fascinated by AI and hear about it every day as work in a tech company.
This book help to have a better understanding of the potential and how it could be used in the creative field.
The book is well written, the explanations are clear and it was enthralling to read the analysis of the different fields of application.
Even if there are no solutions, just a look at what it could, this was a great read, one those book that you must read to have a look at the the future could be.
Highly recommended.
Many thanks to HarperCollins UK and Netgalley for this ARC (less)

Jul 19, 2020Spring rated it liked it

I enjoyed the first half of this book, the math chapters lost me a bit. Chess and Go have finite number of possible moves, no matter how ingenious the strategies one came up with; our question should be ‘can AI come up with new games that fascinate humans like Chess and Go’?

In the near future, computer generated or aided art are still art created by humans, even if they started to evolve and learn based on new data collected, those data are also generated by humans.

Will AI have emotions, a key influence on human creativity where the results resonate feelings within other humans. I wish I could see beyond this, this book sort of left me hanging.

The perfect followup for Kasparov's Deep Thinking book, this book attempts to explain how, and why, most AI algorithms work. The explanation is given by a mathematician and does include some slightly technical jargon, which might not be accessible the laymen (depending on how good their national educational system is).

I disagree on the is usage of the term "human code", because it implies to me (a software developer) that there is some master puppeteer pulling the strings of our, mostly preordained, choices. That might or not be a correct analogy for human behavior. But being in the business of writing code, this feels a very wrong analogy. (less)

this book is for high-schoolers who haven’t yet thought about the topics of AI or creativity. the author gives little technical insight into the AI systems he talks about, hence a lot of chapters seem like a surface level overview rather than a proper dive into the topic. some of the AI or maths stories are interesting, but I was often losing interest in them - it just felt as though he is rambling on without any direction. nevertheless, there is a few nice ideas here and there, although they never get developed to their full potential. a good book for youngsters who want to get excited about AI, but there is very little new information or synthesized ideas. (less)

An attempt to link art and the current state of AI. It doesn't quite work. Let's start with a common misconception the author repeats early on. It is not the lack of enough data that what the inhibition to deep learning, as too many people claim, it's that computers didn't have the performance to reasonably run large enough networks. Cloud technology gave us that.

The rest of the book is a bunch of maundering with a few interesting examples. There's no real conclusion because there can't be one, we're still moving. It's not bad, it's just not good or that enlightening. (less)

I really loved this book and I couldn't put it down unless I had to sleep. The explanation of how the AI was learning and improving by itself and how some algorithms can be turned into a painting or music or play games and beat world champions was absolutely fascinating.
I felt like I was on a tour and after I read the chapter that was about Alphago I watched the real documentary and it felt really good to watch the real people experiencing the feelings that you just read about and everything about it was just great.

In The Creativity Code, Marcus du Sautoy (a University of Oxford mathematician) dives into an exploration between the lines of artificial intelligence and human creativity through stories and examples on games, art, music, storytelling, and songwriting to name a few; the history of machine learning algorithms; and if programmed machines can develop a form of consciousness, producing this human trait of creativity, or just give an illusion of it through imitation. This is an intriguing, well-researched, and written book that I will definitely be rereading. (less)

It's a sad commentary on a book when the only thing it succeeds in doing is disproving its subtitle.
This book has some interesting parts but in general it fell into the "ooh, gee-wiz" look at all the cool things AI is doing and then, one by one, these chapters concede that AI is nothing of the kind.

The best parts of this book concerned mathematics and the hunt for new learning in that field.
However, any expectation that there exists any AI that actually thinks or understand is dashed.

The final chapters of this book were a slog. Don't bother. (less)

This is a book by a mathematician about maths. Much more so than about AI creativity. I was expecting the book to focus on artistic, writing and musical developments so I persevered up until chapter 13. But by then I just couldn't stand listening to any more about prime numbers, equations or algebra. There's a few interesting chapters in there but overall just felt too much off topic and not at all what I wanted to listen to. (less)

A well written, interesting book. However, there’s not a huge amount here for those already familiar with modern techniques in AI and the relevant mathematical concepts. I think du Sautoy spends rather too long emphasising and re-emphasising certain points and could have moved on and made a bit more progress. After several hundred pages I don’t feel like I’ve learnt a huge amount, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

I thought this book underdelivered a bit on the main topic (how AI can or could potentially be "creative"), but there were a lot of neat details about mathematics and history of computing in general. Someone less deep in the weeds of the study of AI to begin with might get more out of it.

Three things I learned:
1. Our own brains have two competing systems -- one to create, one to inhibit or question the drive to create (e.g. a stroke survivor with the latter system damaged felt a compulsion to paint everywhere) -- roughly mirroring the structure of GANs.
2. Composers (whether human or machine) usually start by learning Bach, because he had such a strong underlying structure to his compositions (you could perhaps call them "algorithmic")
3. Jean Lescure's "N+7" algorithm: Take all nouns in a text and change them to the next one 7 words down in the dictionary (preserving all other words and structure): http://www.spoonbill.org/n+7/texts/ex... (less)

The more I read about AI, the more excited and terrified I become. This book shows the growth of AI into creative fields like art, literature and music, raising the question if machines are creative. While they still cannot recognize images easily, machines can create pieces of art, literature and even music following patterns, but right now they are tools for art creation, since they still don´t have a conscience (yet).

A few takeaways:

Three kinds of creativity: exploratory (testing brand new waters, blank slate), combinatory (combining two fields), and transformative (ex., making art as you work through grief)

AI (creativity) still does not have the ability to self reflect and/or evaluate

Creativity is an expression of free will. Seems impossible to automate or program free will, because that would contradict what free will means.

Fantastic overview of how AI is becoming a large part of every day life.
Amazing explanation of the Go algorithm and how it "created new moves" that had never been seen before.
Fantastic breadth of AI topics (Music, Visual Arts, Gaming, etc).
A little slow toward the last 20 pages or so.
However, this book will stimulate your imagination about how AI is impacting things, how fast the changes are occurring and how your interaction with technology will be impacted by those changes. (less)

I have been planning to read this book as soon as I could find it online. Although most of the content is something that I have already known through my education and personal interest it was a fun read to recap the advancements in AI until 2020. I am glad that the author talks about consciousness as an integral part of creativity and even though machine learning is promising we are still very behind on the progress of fully "creative AI". (less)

WOW! This was a thought provoking book. A1 is the next human enemy. I wonder if it can fight Covid19? This is a slow start but hang on in there, to discover how A1 can do creativity: including drawing and design better than the human genius!
We need to be aware of how this will impact lives (and jobs) in the future.
A fabulous read and I highly recommend it.

Book is excellent for an introductory view on AI and impact on man made creative endeavors. Coming from a mathematician’s perspective adds an additional layer of nuance that bolsters the substance of the novel. Even still, I was left wanting more specifics behind algorithm design. I suppose I thought he would explore AI behind the scenes wiring viewed from a mathematician’s perspective, but instead the author examined how an AI would tackle the problems a mathematician experiences.

Stimulating, just the right level of technicality for me but always rapidly returning to the surface for breath. The author strongly believes that Mathematics is actually story-telling, and I think he makes strong points in his favour, although I studied Maths at University, and it never felt like this to me. The last section on Storytelling really resonated, "being able to share our conscious worlds through stories is what makes us human". (less)
