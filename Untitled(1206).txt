Your invention, the hyperbolated gumball, is a crumpled or wound-up ball made from printed yarn or paper that can be used as a storage method for books and other information.

The idea is to use the crumpling or winding as a way to compress and store information in a compact, durable form that is easy to transport.

One possible connection to the story is the idea of preserving and transmitting knowledge across time and space. In the story, the main character is trying to communicate a message to future generations, and the hyperbolated gumball could be seen as a way to do just that.

By storing information in a compact and durable form, it could be transported across great distances or even through time, allowing knowledge to be shared and preserved.

Another possible connection is the idea of using technology for both good and bad purposes. In the story, the technology that the main character develops is ultimately used as a weapon by a government agency.

Similarly, the hyperbolated gumball could be used for both good and bad purposes. On the one hand, it could be used to distribute food and information to people in need. On the other hand, it could be used to spread propaganda or other harmful messages.

Overall, the connection between your invention and the story is the idea of using technology to transmit and preserve information, and the potential for that technology to be used for both good and bad purposes.
