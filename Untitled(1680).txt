All right.

Let's see your assignment cards.

What are you Clickers
doing out tonight?

We're on free time.

We're not obligated to answer.

As a member of the
surveillance committee

of the Order of Flesh and
Blood, I demand an answer.

We're going to the
temple to be recharged.

I think I'll keep you here
till your power runs out.

How'd you like that?

I'd have to report such
interference to the police.

Release them.

Was that satisfactory, Cragis?

Well, the order just
wants to keep them

mindful of their status.

You overlooked one
little thing, though.

What?

The robot that didn't
talk had a forged card.

Forged?

Why he can be
disassembled for that.

Let's pick them up.

Be patient.

Well, the temple is
just around the corner

and it's out of bounds for us.

He'll get away.

Well, they have to come out.

And if they're taking a
chance using a forged card,

they must be up to something

that the Order of Flesh and
Blood might be interested in
