 yeah that's interesting um so

let me see if I can uh steal man this

quickly I this is the one time in my

life where I am the one that has a heart

out in 5 minutes I'm so [ __ ]

horrified this is so interesting to me

um so I'll try to do it quickly okay so

um we have a pyramid scheme in that

there are only so many jobs and I'll

even abstract it from being a lawyer

which is very easy to understand there's

only so many people make partner being a

teacher it's easy to understand you can

only create so many other teachers and

obviously we're talking at higher

education um and I'll just say your

normal job I've told my employees this

like look every step you go up you

there's fewer available positions until

you get to the CEO and there's only one

so there's only like you can get

promotion I've never thought of there

being sort of a a money does not strike

me as the finite resource the promotion

strikes me as a finite resource you can

keep making more and more money

depending on the health of the company

and your contributions to it so that's

part of my bias is that when I try to

use just first principles I'm like if

this person is that valuable to me I'm

going to [ __ ] pay them because I have

fear of loss I don't want to lose them

so which is why default to create fear

of loss in your employer if you want

more money but the company has to be

doing well so let me stick to the Ponzi

scheme here so um very interesting take

on immigration so you have people coming

into the system they're willing to work

cheaper than the other people would

otherwise work in the system you got to

be careful about that but keep going

it's interesting I'm trying to represent

your position no no no but what I'm

trying to say is that really the biggest

issue is push out the labor supply

curve you say that another way your wage

is your price yep and I bring people

from foreign countries to make sure you

can't compete because they'll do it for

cheap no that's not that I mean may

maybe the idea is that you're you'll

you're a superior source of Labor who's

you whoever you are you're the

domestic let's assume that you're a

worker inside of the US yep the big play

in some sense of the previous

generations the silent generation and

more importantly the Baby Boomers was

internationalism which they called

globalization and the hidden part of

globalization that wasn't the United

Colors of beniton was the idea if we can

just break our dependence on each other

other and look abroad and talk tell a

beautiful story about what we're going

to do for Africa and Asia then the idea

is is that we can continue to grow our

slice of the pie even though the pie

might not be growing at the same rate

because from my perspective as a silent

generation or baby boomer I'm focused on

a slice not the pie and so there was a

huge amount of value gotten from

tricking people into thinking that

globalization was this beautiful Davos

inspired uh kind of philanthropy that

was going to be a rising tide to raise

all boats

and those Americans who had rights

inside of our system and this goes for

Brits who had British rights and French

had French rights

whatever had a right that was valuable

which is I have asymmetric access to my

labor market and that's how we worked as

a nation so now you start the the

world's greatest PR Campaign which is

patriotism doesn't exist it's only

nationalism and of course nationalism is

really Ultra nationalism which is

jingoism which is a precursor to Nazism

so you start saying you know I kind of

believe in citizenship and patriotism

and now you're telling me that that's

I'm a bad person and now you've got the

Davos crowd talking about financial

inclusion in Africa and Asia and you

notice that they're not really that

interested in Michigan or

Alabama and it's a it's an tell me why

they're not because I felt like I

understood it until told me that I was

getting because the amount of value you

see if I had to purchase your rights

uhhuh and I wrote to what well your

asymmetric access to your labor market I

wrote a paper called migration for the

benefit of all published in the

international in the um International

Journal of Labor I forget what the title

is migration for the benefit of all

which said if you pay people for their

rights like if the Baby Boomers in

silence said look we think we can get

better labor outside and we want to pay

you for the right to shop

elsewhere then the idea is that

everybody would have been better off and

we would have all screamed Kumbaya each

other as we got rich together but

instead what they said is you're a

protectionist and a jingoist and a

xenophobe we loaded them up with as much

negative imagery as we could POS you're

just a bad person and they were doing

that though so they can get cheaper

labor right so they can keep you from

having leverage you keep saying it as

we're we're willing to work below but my

point is is that if this coffee mug MH

cost

$10 and now we have 10,000 coffee

mugs it's not that those coffee mugs are

are willing to be uh bought for Less the

entire cost of coffee mugs plummets it's

just pushing out the supply curve on

labor and wages its price so it behaves

much as supply and demand should now you

can then point out you can make lots of

other arguments like well some of these

people are starting business and people

are not coffee mugs and these are the

most vibrant members of our so you know

you cue Stars and Stripes Forever you

put your right hand over your heart but

the key point was is that all of these

arguments were necessary to keep the

institutional structure going as the

Ponzi scheme ran out and a lot of this

has to do with what I've called fake

growth downsizing offshoring immigration

securitization it's just this mind

numbing

uh parade of different techniques that

these older Generations have used to

keep a system afloat that has been

saying we're exhausted like the law

firms are supposed to fail the

universities are supposed to fail all

sort the newspapers are don't make sense

as a business model and things that

you're creating and that we all might

create would be replacing these things

but instead what we've done is we've

come up with an exotic kind of economic

parabiosis where we're going to

transfuse our fellow Americans and the

younger generations to pay for a group

of people who are just far too expensive

to keep living in the style to which

they have unjustly become accustomed so

I'm sorry about your hard stop but I

think that there's a tremendous amount

to be excited about and enthusiastic

about because in essence getting back to

your original Point you're right about

the Matrix for 50 years we've been in a

constellation of ideas suppressing the

really interesting new ideas and calling

names on anybody who would propose ideas

that would point out the unstable nature

of of our Market democracy and right now

what we're doing is is we're living

through the beginning of a global

lowgrade revolution of a type that we've

never seen before if you like that clip
