The Creativity Code: How AI Is Learning to Write, Paint and Think

Marcus du Sautoy

The award-winning author of The Music of the Primes explores the future of creativity and how machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be human.

Can a well-programmed machine do anything a human can―only better? Complex algorithms are choosing our music, picking our partners, and driving our investments. They can navigate more data than a doctor or lawyer and act with greater precision. For many years we’ve taken solace in the notion that they can’t create. But now that algorithms can learn and adapt, does the future of creativity belong to machines, too?

It is hard to imagine a better guide to the bewildering world of artificial intelligence than Marcus du Sautoy, a celebrated Oxford mathematician whose work on symmetry in the ninth dimension has taken him to the vertiginous edge of mathematical understanding. In The Creativity Code he considers what machine learning means for the future of creativity. The Pollockizer can produce drip paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock, Botnik spins off fanciful (if improbable) scenes inspired by J. K. Rowling, and the music-composing algorithm Emmy managed to fool a panel of Bach experts. But do these programs just mimic, or do they have what it takes to create? Du Sautoy argues that to answer this question, we need to understand how the algorithms that drive them work―and this brings him back to his own subject of mathematics, with its puzzles, constraints, and enticing possibilities.

While most recent books on AI focus on the future of work, The Creativity Code moves us to the forefront of creative new technologies and offers a more positive and unexpected vision of our future cohabitation with machines. It challenges us to reconsider what it means to be human―and to crack the creativity code. (less)

Superficial. I got it mainly to read the AlphaGo / Demis Hassabis parts but there was nothing new. It was all very rote. When I got to the section entitled "What is Art?" I rolled my eyes. (less)

OK read. I was hoping for more on machine learning and wider range of machine creativity than the focus on music; but I learnt a bunch of stuff I never knew before.

The subject is what kept me reading this book. The writing was not great, especially when the key term of the book is left undefined. As an introduction, it worked well and got me curious.

May 15, 2021Donald Schopflocher rated it it was amazing

Stunning! Perhaps the best piece of popular science writing I have ever read! This spectacular journey through the algorithms and accomplishments of artificial intelligence touches on game playing, art, mathematics, music, language, and story-telling in a sophisticated attempt to understand how man differs from machine and whether it may always be so.

The most interesting part for me occurs when the author realizes that the neural network solutions generated by AlphaGo in mastering the game of Go remain a black box to AlphaGo’s programmers. This overlaps with work in which I was involved trying to understand how neural networks encode knowledge and whether that knowledge is useful and ‘new’ (see writings by MRW Dawson and members of his lab). This reaches even farther back to a century old mathematical-statistical procedure generically called factor analysis that has been applied to tables of covariation to try to induce knowledge of causal entities underlying these patterns. (less)

Hopefully the last AI book I read/listen to that offers the often told, lengthy historical discussion surrounding chess. Would love to read fresh takes on AI, 2022 and forward, proving that progress is being made in this scientific field.

An AI book written by a mathematician so trusting it’s accurate and filled with facts. Anyone interested in AI’s influence on art would likely find this book thought-provoking and a very good read/listen.

Takeaways—
*there’s more to AI than statistics and data science
*AI-generated artwork including music and literature are at a level indistinguishable from artwork done by well-regarded artists. Initially, to me the idea of AI-generated art seemed hollow like we were giving a machine or some algorithm more credit than it deserved, for isn’t art a form of human expression based on personal human experience? But looking at a sunset, pictures the Webb telescope recently took of nebulae, ocean waves crashing to shore and these non-manmade things are emotive invoking on par with artists I admire. So why shouldn’t AI-generated art be acceptable as real art and not some composite machine trick? Always thought machine bias got inadvertently built-in by programmers or from tinged data, never that it could be ascribed by a user/observer. (less)

If you enjoyed this, I recommend reading Finding Zero: A Mathematician's Odyssey to Uncover the Origins of Numbers, as it has a similar vibe, wherein a mathematician goes on an exciting quest to uncover the truth about a controversial math topic. However, The Creativity Code was different in that this mathematician, du Sautoy, was deeply concerned with understanding art. As someone who works in the arts, I found du Sautoy's exposition on different art works to be both amusing (in its philosophical angst) and very interesting (in its precise analysis).
Some of the examples involving mathematical proofs was not quite as captivating and could be difficult to follow/understand (especially as an audiobook) but overall this was a worthwhile read. (less)

Aug 10, 2021Chris Esposo rated it liked it  ·  review of another edition

Marcus Du Sutoy has written a discursive tour on applications “deep” neural network technology, a subset of modern AI and machine learning, on topics within the “arts” and that have traditionally been viewed solely the domain of human agents, including mastering intricate board games of strategy (though this view of sole dominion has been less the case in this area than others outlined in the book in recent history), music, art, and the development of mathematics itself.

The most interesting aspect of Du Sutoy’s book is the first few chapters where he follows the DeepMind/AlphaGo team, describes their problem, and does a decent job explaining the apparatus underlying their system. AlphaGo was a significant departure from an expert Chess playing system for several reasons, but most importantly, whereas “solving” chess amounts to an engineering task of building increasingly run-time efficient game-state tree traversal procedures, because the number of states possible in Go is several orders of magnitude larger than Chess, you cannot contextualize the computer science of Go in a similar manner.

Du Sutoy stays on this topic too short, and quickly moves onto other areas, who’s coverage is less compelling, simply because either he does not cover their depths sufficiently other than to say “deep learning does it” (or something more or less at that level of exposition) or in some ways his chosen application is trivial. His real aim as he states early on in the text is to understand whether this new crop of AI procedures can replace himself as a mathematician. Spoiler, he answers in the negative (to his relief).

There is the kernel of a really compelling in depth book here. Unfortunately Du Sutoy (or his editors) didn’t let him write that book. Instead, he’s written a decent layman tour of recent applications of DNNs, which is written well enough to get you curious, but not deep enough to give you anything useful. Though it may be unfair as the balance between textbook/monograph and layman text is a hard one to achieve. Yet, exactly because Du Sutoy apparently didn’t even try means that his book is just one in a pile of such books. Conditional recommend if you need another tech book to read to kill time.

May 26, 2020Daniel Gibson rated it really liked it

I agree with Jeanette Winterson's evaluation of this book: "A brilliant travel guide to the coming world of AI." Du Sautoy presents anecdotal examples of how artificial intelligence is encroaching on intellectual territory on which humans had a monopoly, up to now. There are programs to play chess or Go; programs to compose classical pieces or improvise jazz solos; programs to paint; programs to prove mathematical theorems. The Creativity Code is a lovely reality check on the current world of AI. Du Sautoy asks an awful lot of important questions which humanity may soon have to seriously consider: who owns the rights to an artistic work created by an AI? Will there come a time when AI is better than us at everything? What will it mean to be human, if and when that time comes?

Du Sautoy rarely gets too deep into the philosophical side of things - a wise move considering the can of worms that is the consciousness debate. Get hold of some Daniel Dennett or Douglas Hofstadter if you'd like that perspective. Nonetheless, this popular science book remains interesting and thought-provoking. (less)

Great introduction to how AI can and does influence music, writing and art. A mathematician investigates what it takes for AI to be creative, which leads him to think about what human creativity means to us.

Aug 05, 2019to'c rated it really liked it  ·  review of another edition

Some very deep thinking went into this book. The author takes his search for the meaning of creativity into surprising and unexpected places. Not all of them machine based, but the use of machines in all aspects of creativity is covered both broadly and deeply. Not just a "history of AI" but a fun and intriguing exploration into what it means to "create". He begins with Margaret Boden's definition of creativity, "the ability to come up with ideas that are new, surprising, and valuable", and searches the world for how humans have used machines to meet it. What I particularly like is how he expands "value" to beyond the merely financial.

A book of ideas as much as pursuit of creativity. It will spark some in you.

I enjoyed it enough that I've finally grabbed The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics from off the bookshelf where it's these many years and cracked it open. (less)

Nov 09, 2019Colin Maclennan rated it it was amazing

Fascinating account of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and how computers learn. Starts with a detailed account of AlphaGo, and how the algorithm was able learn by playing against itself until it could beat Lee Sedol, the best human player. Marcus Du Sautoy is evidently a Go player.

Du Sautoy then goes on to describe the application of these techniques to creating new works in the style of famous artists and composers. It does so well enough to fool experts. Du Sautoy opens his book by addressing the philosophical question raised by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, “Can a computer create something?” Ada Lovelace was firmly of the view that a computer could produce nothing that had not been programmed into it by a human in the first place. Du Sautoy does not reach a conclusion on this, but certainly suggests the question is much more open than Ada Lovelace thought. (less)

I would recommend this book to people who enjoy science and technology, namely A.l. This way you get more from the book. The author didn't go into a deep dive approach (and he could, after all he is a mathematician) nevertheless it good to have a background.
The book is relatively recent which is good to give you a perspective on which stage is AI today. The book covers several areas of it's practical applications to create new stuff, with reflections along the way, most about humans vs machines. I like it.
Nice ending chapter sums it up pretty well. (less)
