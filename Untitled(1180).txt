"For some, harmony between thought and reality is to be found in a grammar made by embedding symbolic logic in a so-called meta-language, i.e. a natural language such as English. We seek to compare harmonies in learned works composed by pure mathematicians, empirical scientists and engineers. Of course, these composers are preconditioned by their disciplines to seek harmonies in their works where they may or may not lie. Pure mathematicians seek harmony among thoughts. This is the mental world. Empirical scientists and engineers seek harmony between thought and the real world. Herein, however, the possibility is considered that engineers may not always find harmony there. Instead, they may find it between thought and the assigned world, a hyperreal world or enlargement of the real world. Dream states, the speculated spiritual world, the imaginary worlds of artists, all are instances of such an enlargement. Accordingly, harmony may be found in the grammars of these works. Focus is put on works whose grammars are made by embedding abstract algebra in English."
