I have Aphantasia, so articles like this just seem bizarre.

Picturing a bicycle floating across the sky does not seem easy, it seems like a physical impossibility.

To me, picturing or hearing things in order think of them or remember then seems ridiculous and silly.

It's not something I would suggest others could do easily. To me the author seems to lack imagination by assuming that others think in images, just because they do.

I would be very surprised if I ever saw a bicycle flying across the sky, I think I'd remember something like that.

Maybe I have had to compensate. It seems I pretend to have earworms and use visual metaphors and allusions in my speech, but I picked this up from watching movies and reading books.

My memory and visual spatial reasoning have been above average, so it is definitely not something I envied. 

Like it seems to me that people most people have poor memories, they need to concentrate in order to work on ideas and are easily distracted by too much going on.

Literally it feels like I get into an argument anytime the discussion comes up, I always said I have no visual memory and never picture anything, but I don't think I have ever made any progress, as it seems to them like I am lying or making things up. 

They assume I must be picturing things and then describing them, since my words still form images in their mind, but, this doesn't mean that I am thinking of images and then describing them.

And I can do some things easily that they use imagery for so this makes it even more difficult to convince anyone.
