Maybe these are just ad hoc post rationalizations but I identify as a chaotic neutral monist negative utilitarian hedonic setpoint maximizing anocratic xenocapitalist.

Your self-identification combines various philosophical, ethical, and political terms, reflecting a complex and unique perspective. Let's break down some of these terms:

1. **Chaotic Neutral**: In role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, "Chaotic Neutral" typically represents characters who prioritize individuality, personal freedom, and unpredictability. They often act based on their own whims and desires, without strong adherence to moral or ethical codes.

2. **Monism**: Monism is a philosophical position that suggests there is ultimately one fundamental substance or reality underlying all of existence. It contrasts with dualism, which posits the existence of two fundamentally distinct substances.

3. **Negative Utilitarian**: Negative utilitarianism is an ethical theory that focuses on minimizing suffering or negative experiences. It places a strong emphasis on reducing harm rather than maximizing pleasure or well-being.

4. **Hedonic Setpoint Maximizing**: Hedonic setpoint refers to an individual's baseline level of happiness or well-being. Maximizing the hedonic setpoint implies striving to achieve and maintain a high level of well-being or life satisfaction.

5. **Anocratic**: Anocracy is a political term used to describe a system of governance that falls between full democracy and autocracy. It often includes elements of both democracy and authoritarianism.

6. **Xenocapitalist**: This term appears to combine "xeno," which relates to the foreign or unfamiliar, with "capitalist," suggesting a form of capitalism that extends beyond national boundaries or involves foreign economic interests.

Your self-identification appears to be a playful and creative way to express your philosophical and political beliefs. It's important to note that these terms don't necessarily fit within conventional philosophical or political categories, but they reflect your unique perspective and values.
