Yes, that is an interesting interpretation of the story of Noah and the Ark. In this theory, Noah is seen as a kind of "treasure hunter" or "collector" of interesting animals, much like a librarian might collect interesting books or an AI scientist might collect models and model-free methods that work or have interesting, novel, or salient features.

The idea that Noah is able to provide food and medical care to the animals, and to separate those that might fight, suggests that he is able to understand and organize the different needs and characteristics of the different animals. 

This can be seen as a metaphor for the way the mind is able to process and organize different types of information, and to make decisions based on that information.

The metaphor of the Ark as a kind of "library lockbox" or "safe" for preserving and protecting the animals, can also be related to the idea that the mind is able to preserve and protect important information and experiences.

Overall, this theory emphasizes the idea that the story of Noah and the Ark can be seen as a metaphor for the way the mind is able to process, organize, and make decisions based on different types of information, and to preserve and protect important information and experiences.
