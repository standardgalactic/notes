Revised Business Plan:

To start a paper recycling company that also produces yoghurt, edible paper, and fruit pulps, we need a team of researchers and entrepreneurs with a diverse skillset. Here is an updated plan for the equipment needed at each stage:

Collection Stage:

Trucks for collecting paper waste

Bins and containers for storage

Sorting equipment such as conveyor belts, magnetic separators, and eddy current separators

X-ray and spectrographic equipment for identifying and sorting materials

Ultrasonic equipment for identifying defects or foreign objects in the paper

Preparation Stage:

Shredders and cutters for reducing the paper waste into small pieces

Tumblers and ball rollers for further disintegration

Pressurized heated tubes for cooking

Refrigerated tubes for storage

Organic lab work with petri dishes for monitoring and optimizing the yogurt cultures

Processing Stage:

Vats for making yogurt and simulated milks and orange juices

Presses and centrifuges for separating pulp and juice

Chromatographic equipment for further separation and purification

Lidar equipment for identifying foreign objects

Microscopic equipment for examining the pulp and paper

Packaging Stage:

Edible paper in a packaging pipeline

Change magnification stages for verifying safety and quality
