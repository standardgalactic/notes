I have Aphantasia, so articles like this just seem bizarre.

Picturing a bicycle floating across the sky does not seem easy, it seems like it would be physically impossible.

To me, picturing or hearing things in order think of them or remember then seems ridiculous and silly.

It's not something I would suggest others could do easily. To me the author seems to lack imagination by assuming that others think in images, just because they do.

I would be very surprised if I ever saw a bicycle flying across the sky - I think I'd remember something like that.

Anyways, anytime I try to explain it, I end up writing a huge essay

It seems obvious to me that mental imagery is unnecessary for most forms of thought.

It took me like twenty years to prove to myself that others were actually seeing anything in their head, although it still seems unbelievable.
