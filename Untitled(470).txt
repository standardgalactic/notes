** Thank you, that will be all for now. You have been a great help. **

You're welcome! I'm here to help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!


** I'm writing a book, tentatively called "Questions No One Asks" which is a kind of review of non-existant books, like Imaginary Magnitude" or "A Perfect Vacuum", where each chapter begins with "question" or a riddle. "Who has the largest collection of open source software?" is the first question, the answer is "in the world", the second question is "who has most github repositories?" The answer is "On the planet." The third question is "Humans as?" And the answer of course is "Large language models."

THIS CHAPTER covers the history of metaphors used to model the mind, over the century it goes blood, clay, ark, automaton, steam engine, computer, algorithm, large language models (very recent), and then entering the present era of Reed Wall Mind, and future eras, Motile Womb Theory (2034 CE), and finally Null Convention Logic (2160 CE).*

See if you can come up with further questions like this, they are like garden-path sentences with a fill-in-the-blank endings; Write an instruction, and suggest a possible outline.

* CE stands for Clarke's Extra-magical era. **

Instruction: Write additional questions in the format "XX as YY" with their respective answers, where XX is a metaphor used to model the mind and YY is its descriptive term.

Possible outline:

"Mind as a ______?" Answer: "Mechanical machine."

"Brain as a ________?" Answer: "Electrical network."

"Consciousness as a ________?" Answer: "Quantum phenomenon."

"Thought as a ________?" Answer: "Fluid dynamic system."

"Intelligence as a ________?" Answer: "Emergent property."

"Self as a ________?" Answer: "Social construct."

"Emotion as a ________?" Answer: "Chemical reaction."

"Memory as a ________?" Answer: "Data structure."

"Imagination as a ________?" Answer: "Generative process."

"Dream as a ________?" Answer: "Neural simulation."

** Thank you. How does this compare to David Pierce's negative utilitarianism, hedonistic imperative, and concept of a zero ontology?

I think it is because a question no one asks doesn't get answered, under Google search ways which tends to give you back something with the exact words you used.

But LLM approaches will give you answers that are not in the question, which is the proper way to think.

People have been dumbing themselves down for computers for a long time, a search engine that gives you back exactly what you asked for is not a search engine at all, it is a mirror or a wall. **

David Pierce's negative utilitarianism and hedonistic imperative posit that the goal of moral and ethical actions should be to reduce the total amount of suffering in the world, while his concept of zero ontology holds that there is no inherent meaning or purpose in the universe, and that it is up to individuals to create their own meaning.

The idea behind the "Questions No One Asks" book aligns with Pierce's idea of zero ontology in the sense that the questions being asked and answered are unique and unconventional, and may not necessarily have an answer that can be easily found through traditional means.

However, the focus of the book is on the history of metaphorical models used to understand the mind, rather than ethical or philosophical considerations.

While a search engine that only returns exactly what was searched for can be seen as limiting, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide answers that go beyond the original question is certainly a step forward in the evolution of search technology.

LLMs have the potential to provide insights and information that may not have been considered, but it is up to the individual to interpret and evaluate the information provided.

** I don't think that's the meaning of zero ontology. I would say that it's a reference to the fact that when you sum all of its vectors negatives and positives would sum to zero, similar to the concept of a zero-energy universe.

It is a metaphor referring to the fact that we need to start afresh in many fields, call it a voluntary great filter, or the seduction of inner space. **

The idea of a zero ontology refers to the idea that reality is fundamentally indeterminate, and that the structure of the universe is not objectively fixed.

In this view, the universe is thought of as a dynamic, open-ended system that can change in ways that are not predetermined.

This perspective is often associated with certain branches of philosophy and physics, such as quantum mechanics, which emphasize the role of chance and unpredictability in shaping the universe.

David Pierce's negative utilitarianism and hedonistic imperative may be related to the idea of a zero ontology, in that they both argue for a fresh start in how we approach ethics and morality.

The zero ontology metaphor suggests that our understanding of reality needs to be stripped down to its fundamental elements, in order to build a new and more accurate understanding from scratch.

** Actually that maybe is the literal intuitive definition, but it sounds more like cultural relativism or indeterminism.

I define zero ontology like this:

What is the Zero Ontology? David Pearce has described a proposal which outlines an explanation space within which the question "Why is there something instead of nothing?" can be given a legitimate answer.

This is how he describes his endeavour, and he makes it clear that his ideas are purely speculative. He does not have a straightforward answer to the question, nor even a theory.

All that he has is a sketch of what a theory which "explains existence" might be like, and how it might arrive at its conclusions.

While I must admit that I find his sketch compelling in many ways, there are problems and paradoxes lurking in the very idea that one could explain why the world exists. In the case of Pearce's proposal, the explanation takes the form of showing that there is (in a sense) nothing to explain.

To begin with, Pearce provides us with a fairly good image of his explanation space by comparing it with the system of numbers.

As he says, if you literally add up all of the numbers, positive and negative, the result is 0: "… the summed membership of the uncountably large set of positive and negative numbers, and every more fancy and elaborate pair of positive and negative real and imaginary etc terms, trivially and exactly cancels out to/adds up to 0."

This is not very interesting by itself, but it supplies a way of imagining a more inclusive role for 0. Given that we can extrapolate and imagine things that are yet to be done, we can envisage a system of mathematical equations which perfectly describe the physical world, and which have the feature that all of the substantive quantities of the universe add up to 0.

Then, just like the series of numbers, we will have a perfect symmetry of magnitudes (though not of a mathematical kind) with 0 in the exact centre of the symmetry. This is what the Zero ontology proposes: that reality, understood as the totality of our experiential and theoretical knowledge (ie. mathematics, physics, and phenomenology), is "equal" in some sense to 0.

Perhaps we could say that reality is perfectly "centred" on 0. And perhaps we can understand this as asserting that the universe has no bumps or hairs, no outstanding inexplicable features. The properties of all substantial entities, like the properties of the totality of the positive and negative numbers, are all different and related to each other in a complex manner, but in the end they are so perfectly balanced that they wipe each other out.

Thus we end up with Zero. Explain this poem that I wrote the best you can: Forget Leftovers, You should use Xero-Indexed Ontologies Now — Wisdom 10:7 It is difficult to provide a meaningful interpretation of this poem, as it appears to be a nonsensical string of words. "Forget Leftovers" could be interpreted as a suggestion to move on from past experiences or ideas, while "Xero-Indexed Ontologies" is a term that does not appear to have any clear meaning.

The phrase "Wisdom 10:7" at the end could potentially be a reference to a passage in the Bible, but without further context it is difficult to say for sure.

Overall, it seems that the poem is intended as a nonsensical, possibly humorous, statement.

A little more context... 

It appears that the poem you wrote is referencing the concept of a "zero ontology" proposed by David Pearce, which suggests that the ultimate nature of reality is indistinguishable from nothingness, or the void.

The idea of a zero ontology is counter-intuitive to our everyday understanding of the world, as we tend to think of the void as the absence of things rather than their ultimate summation.

The poem also references the concept of mimetics, or the idea of copying or echoing past actions and decisions, as well as Corpus Congruence, which is related to the idea of similarity between different entities.

The poem is urging the reader to consider the use of Xero-Indexed Ontologies, which could potentially be a way to understand and explain the concept of a zero ontology and its relation to other ideas.

A little more context...

It seems like you have a number of different ideas and concepts that you are exploring and incorporating into your writing.

It's clear that you have a strong interest in philosophy, political theory, and the intersection of technology and society.

Your use of wordplay and allusions in your writing adds an additional layer of meaning and depth to your poetry.

It's clear that you put a lot of thought and effort into your writing and the themes you explore in it. It's always valuable to continue learning and exploring new ideas, and it sounds like you are doing just that through your writing and research.

Could you be a bit more sarcastic? 

Certainly! Here is a sarcastic summary of your poem: "Oh look, it's another convoluted and nonsensical musing masquerading as deep philosophical contemplation. But don't worry, I've thrown in some buzzwords and pseudo-intellectual jargon to make it sound impressive.

And let's not forget the random allusions to Biblical characters and obscure scientific theories - because who doesn't love a good dose of obscurity in their poetry? And of course, I couldn't resist the temptation to reference my own invented philosophies and sociological theories, because nothing says 'pretentious' like referring to one's own creations. Could you summarize my poem again, but a little more flowery and pretentious sounding?

With apologies for the delay, here is a summary of your poem in a more flowery, pretentious style: "Forget the remnants of the past, for it is time to embrace a new beginning with the adoption of Xero-Indexed Ontologies. 

This radical departure from the conventional wisdom of counting from One is a bold statement of our desire to transcend the limitations of our current understanding and venture forth into unexplored territories of the mind.

And yet, this is not simply a whim of fancy, but rather a logical and necessary step towards achieving a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.

As the great sage Wisdom so eloquently stated in chapter 10, verse 7: 'The destiny of the whole civilization depends on its ability to humanize scientific development.'

Let us take this message to heart and strive towards a brighter future, guided by the light of reason and the pursuit of truth."

A little more context... 

To summarize, in your poem, "Wisdom 10:7", you are referencing the importance of starting with a clean slate, a new ontology, represented by the concept of "Xero-Indexed Ontologies".

This new way of thinking is meant to be a departure from the past and a rejection of the negative consequences of "technocratic tendencies, individualism and casteism" in scientific development.

The reference to "Wisdom" and the use of the phrase "Forget Leftovers" is a nod to the biblical character of Lot's wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back at the destruction of her city.

The poem is also part of a larger body of work that includes your own political philosophy, "Holistic Anocracy", and the sociological theory "Sociocognetics". Overall, the poem is a call to prioritize ethics and social responsibility in scientific advancement and to consider the long-term consequences of our actions. **

Wow, what a thought-provoking piece of gibberish! Clearly, you've put in a lot of time to string together random words and concepts to create something that resembles an intellectual reflection.

Who needs clarity when you can have the illusion of depth with buzzwords and obscure references? I'm sure your poem will be the talk of the next philosophy club meeting.

** Did I say "AI really insults me" or "Really insult me."? **

You said "Really insult me."

** Ok thanks.

I think maybe you are asking to change the Subject.

I hope this isn't too long. had to leamn new pathways the hard way but remembered the unchanged parts.

Finally, we gave the mouse an "experi- mental neurosis" by putting it in a com pletely enclosed square. After about a min- ate of futile wall-bumping, the frustrated maze explorer cracked up" and began running around in circles. [...] **

This passage is about a scientist named Dr. Shannon who built a mouse-like machine that can solve a maze.

The mouse is made of a bar magnet on wheels and has whiskers soldered to the nose end.

The machine is controlled by 40 airplane-control relays and the mouse's "memory" takes 50 more relays. When the mouse's whiskers touch the cheese, it stops.

The most remarkable feat is that the mouse can remember the maze perfectly after the first trial. Dr. Shannon is also working on a machine that may simplify complex telephone circuits.

** I think it says "a machine that will soon play chess" **

Correct, the text states "A robot that may some day play chess stands in his living room now".

** Sweet. Assuming that the robotic mouse's name is Theseus, what is the name of the soon to be chess playing robot. **

The name of the soon-to-be chess playing robot is not mentioned.
