Let's break this down step-by-step:

14. **Summaries and Vector Space Analysis of Wikipedia**:
   - **Objective**: Use advanced natural language processing and vector space models to parse and summarize Wikipedia content.
   - **Outcome**: Efficient summaries of vast amounts of data, enabling quicker comprehension and better information dissemination.

15. **Generate a Modified Wikipedia**:
   - **Objective**: Deliberately introduce spelling and factual errors into a copy of Wikipedia.
   - **Rationale**: Such a system could be used in educational settings to teach critical thinking, fact-checking, and error detection. Students would learn not to take information at face value and would develop skills to discern and correct errors.

16. **Integration with GitHub**:
   - **Objective**: Use the version control and collaborative capabilities of GitHub to allow edits, corrections, and updates to the modified Wikipedia.
   - **Outcome**: A dynamic and evolving platform where users can collaboratively identify, correct, and discuss errors. This could be particularly useful in educational settings where students can "commit" their corrections and teachers can "review" and provide feedback.

By integrating these steps, we're not only harnessing the potential of AGI for information processing but also promoting an educational environment that fosters critical thinking and collaborative learning. The integration with GitHub further ensures that corrections and edits are tracked, providing a history of changes and facilitating discussions on various topics.
