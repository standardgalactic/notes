My review of the book Science and Sanity (1933). I am another reader whose life was changed by reading this book. I tripped over this dense tome in my searching (half-crazed) teenage phase of life. I think that is the only explanation for how I was able to slough through it. If I had first come across this today there is no way I would give it the time. Someone needs to do a condensed 200 page version. A copy has traveled with me in my life helping me to joyfully live more than 50 years. Each time I think about a problem in my life or in the world I remember what I learned in this book
