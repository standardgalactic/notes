Future Forest: Electronic dance music festival

That gave me a scare. Set my two phones on the bench beside me and left them there. Ten or twenty minutes I realized and went back but they were gone. Luckily they were at the lost and phone. Anyways, I thought this weekend would be a big loss I am sure I payed like a thousand dollars for each although I don't know the exact price because they are in my plan

Anyways, I guess I need to be more careful. I think I'm done painting for now, one or two might be sold but I would appreciate being able to touch them up at home. I hope it is not a big deal that I want to leave tomorrow (Monday). I am not sure if Andrew was planning to leave on Tuesday or what. He knows I got to get back to work and he does as well but we didn't discuss it yet.

Every year I think it is too much. With the rain and all the walking, I didn't feel too motivated. If I stayed closer to the stage, it would be too loud to sleep at night probably. Seeing all the chaos isn't that motivating either, it makes me think that society's problems are too big to solve.

On the other hand, it seems like a form of constraint based programming in that it provides a model or simulation of ecology - a macrocosm of a city. The human body, a house, a family, a community, explored through a form of play acting or simplification of daily life, an exercise in minimalism, and the amorality and plasticity of nature.
