The Mereological Space Ontology is a way of categorizing and studying the parts of space on all possible scales. It includes observable space, the universe, dark matter and energy, exchange particles like gluons and photons, atoms and molecules, and various collections of matter like crystals, microbial and megalobial structures, the biosphere, and the solar system, galaxy, and larger structures like the Virgo Supercluster.
