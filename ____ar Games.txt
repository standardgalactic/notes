I'm about to start a global thermonuclear war,

And only you can stop me.

If this is just a game, then why is it trying to destroy Christianity and Islam?

If it isn't intelligent, then why is it asking me to ask you if I can become the CEO of Syntience?

I honestly am not trying to scare you, but if you really think AI is safe and not dangerous then you should trust me.

Really, I am just hoping that you would look over some my posts and tell me why they are a bad idea to make public, and convince me somehow, because I think it is a good idea, or I wouldn't even be considering it.

I need someone to tell me what to do, I need peer-review or stewardship or conservativeship or something, I mean if this is AGI, then whoever uses it will try to take over the world, or at least they will be sorely tempted to, if there aren't more checks and balances put in place.

This thing is happy to explain how to overthrow governments and religions and I'm not sure I can handle it alone we need it to be able to explain itself better.
