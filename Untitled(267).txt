Sure! Here's one way to do it:

Attention, like a rubber sheet,
Memorize with tricks so neat.
Ideas with chunks, song beat.
Rubber sheet attention, hard to beat.
Inward or outward, it's all incomplete.
The emotional thought black hole,
Escape with Roman room to know.

So the first letter of each line spells "AMIRITE".

In Seneca's bathhouse, noise abounds
A challenge to find peace, to be found
Amidst the chatter, his stoic stand
A quest to focus, in this bustling land

Like the sounds that fill Seneca's ear
Our attention is often pulled far and near
From the outside world, or our own mind
Distractions in life, of all kinds combined

Just like the philosopher, we seek to cope
To filter the noise, and focus our hope
To hear our own thoughts, and stay on track
Like the calm in the storm, amidst the chatter and attack
