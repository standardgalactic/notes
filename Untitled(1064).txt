Fields, skew fields, and near fields are algebraic structures that provide a framework for studying mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication. Here is a more detailed explanation of each concept:

Fields: A field is a set, denoted as K, equipped with two binary operations: addition (+) and multiplication (×). The set K must satisfy the following properties:

Addition forms a group: The operation (+) is associative, commutative, and has an identity element (0). Every element in K has an additive inverse.

Multiplication forms a group (excluding 0): The operation (×) is associative, commutative, and has an identity element (1). Every non-zero element in K has a multiplicative inverse.

Multiplication distributes over addition: For any elements a, b, and c in K, the following equations hold: a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c) and (b + c) × a = (b × a) + (c × a).

Fields are familiar mathematical structures, and examples include the rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers.

Skew Fields: A skew field, also known as a division ring, is a generalization of a field where the multiplication operation does not have to be commutative.

In other words, for elements a and b in a skew field, a × b may not always equal b × a. However, all the properties of a field still hold for a skew field, including the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses.

Skew fields are less common in practice but are essential in certain areas of mathematics, such as non-commutative algebra and representation theory.

Near Fields: A near field is a structure that shares many properties with fields but has a slightly weaker requirement. In a near field, every non-zero element has both a left inverse and a right inverse with respect to multiplication. 

In other words, for any non-zero element a in a near field, there exist elements b and c such that b × a = 1 and a × c = 1. This property guarantees the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements but does not necessarily enforce commutativity of multiplication.

Near fields have applications in coding theory and cryptography, among other areas.

The concept of a field of fractions arises when considering integral domains, which are commutative rings with no zero divisors. Given an integral domain D, the field of fractions, denoted as Frac(D), is constructed by considering equivalence classes of fractions a/b, where a and b are elements of D and b is non-zero.

The field of fractions is defined by formalizing arithmetic operations on fractions and equipping the set of equivalence classes with addition and multiplication.

The field of fractions of an integral domain is a field that contains a subring isomorphic to the original integral domain. It can be viewed as the smallest field in which the elements of the integral domain can be embedded while preserving the arithmetic properties.

Determining whether a ring has a field of fractions is not always straightforward. The existence of a field of fractions depends on various conditions and properties of the ring. One important condition is the Ore condition, which generalizes the notion of a common denominator in commutative rings.

The Ore condition states that for any two non-zero elements a and b in the ring, there exist non-zero elements c and d such that ac = bd. If a ring satisfies the Ore condition, then it has a field of fractions.

In addition to the Ore condition, other conditions and properties of the ring may be necessary or sufficient for the existence of a field of fractions. These conditions may involve quasi-identities, rank of free modules, trivializability of relations, and semifirs (semi-fields).

Quasi-identities are algebraic equations or inequalities that hold true in a given ring. The presence of certain quasi-identities can provide necessary conditions for the existence of a field of fractions. These quasi-identities often involve the ring's operations, such as addition and multiplication, and their relationships.

The rank of free modules is another factor to consider. In the context of a ring, free modules are modules that have a basis, meaning they can be generated by a linearly independent set of elements. The rank of a free module measures the size of its basis. The rank of free modules in a ring can impose necessary conditions on the existence of a field of fractions.

Trivializability of relations is a property related to the structure of a ring. It refers to the ability to simplify or reduce relations between elements in the ring. When relations can be easily reduced to simpler forms, it can indicate the presence of a field of fractions. Trivializability is often associated with semifirs, which are algebraic structures that include free algebras and coproducts of fields.

The study of matrices over rings is also relevant to the existence of a field of fractions. Matrices provide a useful tool for understanding relationships between elements in a ring and can be used in the factorization of elements over principal ideal domains. These factorization techniques and their applications are described in the context of matrices in relation to the existence of a field of fractions.

The final section of the given text discusses the matrix functor and its left adjoint, the matrix reduction functor. These functors play a role in constructing counter-examples and are utilized later in the study of fields and their associated structures.

In summary, the existence of a field of fractions for a given ring depends on various conditions and properties. The Ore condition, quasi-identities, rank of free modules, trivializability of relations, and semifirs are all factors to consider.

The field of fractions is an important concept in algebra and has applications in different areas of mathematics and beyond.
