There are some major problems with General semantics, on the one hand it inspired a lot of rationality movements, transaction analysis, reality therapy, but also less critical applications like neurolinguistic programming. While offering helpful heuristics, it doesn't offer much of a categorization scheme, model of world, or operationalized definitions. Primarily it seeks to document the change in worldview that had already occurred in moving from linear and newtonian physics to quantum mechanics. and relativity. He goes on a lot about semantogenic and psychogenic origins of diseases, proves a lot of his arguments with "I wouldn't be surprised if..." or "once you read the whole book you'll see..."

You raise some valid points about the limitations and potential issues with General Semantics as presented in "Science and Sanity."

It's true that while General Semantics has been influential in the development of various rationality movements, therapy methods and self-help approaches, it does not offer a comprehensive model of the world or a systematic set of operationalized definitions. The book is more focused on the structure of language and its influence on our perception and understanding of the world, rather than providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the world.

Additionally, the author's use of anecdotal evidence and lack of empirical data to support some of his arguments can be seen as a limitation. While the author acknowledges the need for further research and testing of his ideas, the book relies heavily on the author's own observations and interpretations.

The book also touches on the connection between language, perception, and health, but it does not provide a comprehensive or well-researched understanding of the relationship between semantogenic and psychogenic origins of diseases.

It's important to note that the book was written in the 1930s, and some of the ideas and concepts presented in the book may not be supported by current scientific understanding and research. Additionally, the book is a product of its time and reflects the scientific and cultural context of the time it was written.

In summary, while General Semantics, as presented in "Science and Sanity," offers a unique perspective on language, perception, and understanding, it is important to approach the book with a critical eye and consider its limitations. The book can be a valuable resource for those interested in the structure of language and its influence on our perception and understanding of the world, but it should not be considered as a comprehensive model of the world or a substitute for scientific research and evidence-based practices.
