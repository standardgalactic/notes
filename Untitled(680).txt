Sure, I can help fill in and map it better to the original description. Here's my attempt:

Observing (See) the different sizes (Big-Little) of shiny (Shiny-stuff) things (Blocks), sharing and exchanging (Sharing) hidden (Hidden) tiny (Tiny) elements and sorting them into groups (Sorting), including both the smallest particles (Tiny) and larger collections of matter (Big groups), like crystals (Shiny-rock), microbial and megalobial structures (Life), the biosphere (Big place), the sun, moon, and stars (Sun-Moon-Stars), and even larger structures like galaxies and superclusters (Big-group). There are exchange particles like gluons and photons (Strings), atoms and molecules (Building) involved in these structures.
