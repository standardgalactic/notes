Etiam periculum vitrum caligatio collectivo cavere debemus
et suppressionem novarum notionum ab institutionibus.

The themes of the three poems are:

The first poem, titled "LIFE, REASON, and a DEEP THEOLOGICAL QUESTION", explores the concept of life and how it can be difficult to see, even though it is all around us. It also touches on the idea of reason and how we think we understand simple things, but in reality, we don't know as much as we think we do.

The poem poses a deep theological question about whether or not God can make a rock so big he couldn't lift it, and ultimately concludes that the question is nonsense and doesn't matter.

The second poem, titled "XYLOID once and for all", reflects on the wonders of the natural world and its ability to sustain life on earth.

The poem touches on the idea that working together and utilizing collective knowledge is necessary to overcome challenges.

The author uses imagery of rising columns, organic compounds, photosynthesis, and exhalation of oxygen to evoke the interconnectedness and wonder of nature.

The third poem, titled "DIGEST NUMBER 18", reflects on the idea that life is not always easy and can be full of disappointment.

The skies are described as "huge, looming grey skies" and "blocking out the sun", suggesting that life can be difficult and dark.

The poem compares life to a roller coaster, suggesting that some people believe it to be full of thrill and excitement without a destination, but ultimately, it is a train that we have control over and can direct its course.

The poem seems to suggest that people may ignore this control and end up exactly where they were headed.

The title may be a reference to the magazine "Reader's Digest" or to the author's age at the time of writing the poem.
