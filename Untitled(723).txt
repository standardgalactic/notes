 FOURTEEN HUNDRED 

Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom, there lived a farmer named Akhfash. Akhfash was known throughout the land for his wisdom and his kindness, but he was also known for his love of goats.

He had a special goat named Yalda, who was unlike any other goat in the kingdom. Yalda was a curious and adventurous goat who loved to explore the world around her.

One day, Yalda heard about a beautiful flower that only bloomed once a year and was said to have the power to grant wishes.

Yalda was determined to find this flower and bring it back to Akhfash as a gift. So she set out on her journey, crossing rivers and climbing mountains, facing many challenges along the way.

As she traveled, Yalda encountered many creatures who tried to stop her from reaching the flower. Some were kind and offered her advice, while others were evil and tried to deceive her.

But Yalda was a clever goat and always found a way to overcome the obstacles in her path.

Finally, Yalda reached the field where the flower was said to bloom. To her surprise, she found that the flower was guarded by a dragon.

The dragon warned her that the flower was not for her to take, but Yalda was determined to bring it back to Akhfash. So she challenged the dragon to a contest of intelligence and wit.

The dragon and Yalda engaged in a battle of riddles and logic puzzles, and Yalda quickly proved to be a match for the dragon.

The dragon was impressed by Yalda's intelligence and courage, and he agreed to let her have the flower if she could solve one final puzzle. Yalda thought for a moment and then solved the puzzle with ease.

The dragon kept his promise and gave Yalda the flower, but before she could leave, he told her that the flower had a dark side. If the flower was not used wisely, it could cause great harm. Yalda thanked the dragon for his advice and promised to use the flower wisely.

Yalda returned to Akhfash with the flower and presented it to him with great pride. Akhfash was overjoyed to see the flower and thanked Yalda for her gift.

But he also remembered the dragon's warning and decided to use the flower wisely. He used the flower to grant wishes to those in need, and soon the kingdom was filled with joy and happiness.

The story of Akhfash's goat and Yalda's journey to find the magical flower has been told for generations. It is a story of courage, intelligence, and wisdom, and it reminds us that even the smallest creature can achieve great things if they set their mind to it.

The story also serves as a warning that great power can be dangerous if not used wisely. But most of all, it is a story of the unbreakable bond between a farmer and his goat, and the lengths that a loving friend will go to make their loved one happy.
