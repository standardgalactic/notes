There is a deep shift happening nobody is talking about

Natural language is becoming the interface of technology

Writing code is time consuming and inefficient in communicating context-specific complex needs 

It is a one-way conversation, not an iterative dialogue 

As AI models become more sophisticated and intuitive, two-way interactive conversations become possible

Specialists at writing code who today command top salaries will be largely replaced by AI agents 

AI agents will be able to develop technology without humans

While on the one hand many jobs will be replaced, this also signifies a radical democratization of technology 

This shift can be incredibly empowering 

Anyone now has the ability to have an AI team of executives, coaches, assistants working on their behalf 

Anyone will be able to develop an idea into an application, product, or service

Anyone will be able to create movies, TV series, marketing campaigns

Humans will need to learn how to engage in dialogue, first principles thinking, and creative problem solving

These are the skills essential for success in the future 

This radical shift has the potential to catalyze a profound awakening and transformation of consciousness 

If you can imagine it, you can do it, all by yourself 

The limitations placed upon you by society, by media, by the circumstances of your birth, can all be shattered 

A new frontier is opening
