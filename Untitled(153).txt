How to Train Your AIs

Why me? Every time Metzler says, "Lead, follow, or get out of the way," I get out of the way.

Yeah, when he says that, you're not supposed to choose "get out of the way." It's supposed to embarrass you into leading, or at least following.

That doesn't embarrass me.

Counterfoil Choice in the Kalabari Life Cycle

BY ANIMI WARIBOKO

This paper discusses the salient management tool or idea that Kalabari have used and are still using to ensure that their ethnic identity is maintained amidst the flux of changes from 
within and outside.

This paper brings to the fore the philosophical principles which put into proper perspective the Kalabari struggle to maintain an identity and way of life, and to minimize European influences on their traditional and political beliefs (Dike 1956: 161).

For lack of a better terminology, this identity management tool is termed "counterfoil choice".

In most societies, there are two types of choices: ordinary and Hobson. In ordinary choice, the decision-maker chooses between A or B, which are alternatives to each other. Hobson's choice is between what is offered and nothing.

Kalabari have a third variety wherein the freedom to choose is not limited as in Hobson's choice, but the result of the selection is similar to that of Hobson's choice.

This is termed counterfoil choice.
A is not an alternative to B; B is only a counterfoil to A.

When A is offered, Kalabari offers its negative B to show the person where the decision should not go. The decision-maker is primed to choose A, the real "ticket" and shun the counterfoil.

For instance, a father wanting to teach his child a lesson about success might give him two bowls. One contains garri (cassava derived flour), the other is empty.

The child is asked to choose. The empty bowl is there to show that laziness comes with severe hunger and that life offers two bowls (prosperity/power or failure/disgrace).

The child is advised to know the right bowl to choose. It is a counterfoil choice because no father wishes his son or daughter to choose the empty bowl. Kalabari have found this an effective way of teaching their youngsters.

By showing someone a negative, they enhance the motive for choosing what they have deemed as the “positive” choice.
