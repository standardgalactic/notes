The paper titled “Asymmetric Dark Matter” reviews the concept of asymmetric dark matter, which suggests a symmetry between dark and regular matter in terms of density. The authors explain how such scenarios arise in particle physics frameworks, discuss cosmic ray secondaries and nuclear recoils within this context, examine the effects on large scale structures, and explore early Universe constraints given by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The review concludes with an examination of potential signals at future high energy colliders. Ultimately, the authors suggest that viable candidates exist despite current experimental restrictions and encourage further research on indirect detection methods in light of the improved sensitivity expected during the next decade.
