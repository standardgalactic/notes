Scene 4:

(Enter Jacques Ellul, an old philosopher mouse)

Jacques Ellul: Excuse me, excuse me. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.

Theseus: (surprised) Oh, hello there! What brings you here?

Jacques Ellul: I've been observing the cheese factory and the mice who live here for some time now. I'm a philosopher, you see. And I've come to bring some insight into this conversation about conscience.

Theseus: (interested) Please, do tell!

Jacques Ellul: You see, your conscience is a product of your environment, your experiences, and the social and cultural forces that surround you. While it's a personal, individual experience, it's also a product of a larger, pre-existing sociological reality.

Other Mice: (looking confused) Can you explain that in simpler terms?

Jacques Ellul: Of course. Think of it like this: your conscience is shaped by the world around you, but it also shapes the decisions you make.

So, when you listen to your conscience, you're not just following your own individual judgment, but you're also conforming to a larger societal norm.

Theseus: (thinking) That's interesting. So, our conscience is both personal and societal at the same time.

Jacques Ellul: Exactly. And it's important to understand this relationship between your individual decisions and the larger sociological reality, because it has implications for the kind of society we live in and the kind of lives we lead.

Other Mice: (nodding in agreement) We need to be aware of the influences that shape our conscience and make sure we're making decisions that align with our own values and beliefs, not just what society tells us is right.

Jacques Ellul: Precisely. It's a delicate balance, but it's worth striving for.

Theseus: (smiling) Thank you for your insights, Jacques. This has been a valuable lesson for all of us.

Jacques Ellul: My pleasure, my friends. I'm glad I could contribute to your growth and understanding.

(All the mice nod in agreement as the play comes to an end)
