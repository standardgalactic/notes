Title; Cytoelectric Coupling: Electrical Fields Fine-Tune Brain Functioning

See… https://neurosciencenews.com/cytoelectric-coupling-neuroscience-23306/

Summary: Scientists present a hypothesis dubbed “Cytoelectric Coupling” suggesting electrical fields within the brain can manipulate neuronal sub-cellular components, optimizing network stability and efficiency. They propose these fields allow neurons to tune the information-processing network down to the molecular level.

Comparatively, this process is akin to households arranging their TV setup for optimal viewing experience. The theory, open for testing, could significantly enhance our understanding of the brain’s inner workings.

Key Facts:

[1/ The Cytoelectric Coupling hypothesis suggests the brain’s electrical fields can fine-tune network stability and efficiency by influencing neuronal sub-cellular components.
2/ The brain’s ability to adapt to a changing world includes proteins and molecules that interact with electric fields generated by neurons.
3/ This new theory, suggesting a connection from macroscopic to microscopic level in the brain, is a testable hypothesis that could revolutionize our understanding of brain functioning.

A new paper by researchers at MIT, City —University of London, and Johns Hopkins University posits that the electrical fields of the network influence the physical configuration of neurons’ sub-cellular components to optimize network stability and efficiency, a hypothesis the authors call “Cytoelectric Coupling.”

“The information the brain is processing has a role in fine-tuning the network down to the molecular level,” said Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, who co-authored the paper in Progress in Neurobiology with Associate Professor Dimitris Pinotsis of MIT and City —University of London, and Professor Gene Fridman of Johns Hopkins.
