This Embryo Model shows the development of the human germ cells from the point of fertilisation through to the end of the second month of pregnancy, represented in 12 stages.

The models come on a common stand but can all be indiviually removed for closer study. A great model for for teaching and testing in the specialist field of embryology.Â 

The embryonic stages featured are:

Ovum at time of fertilisation (conception) with male gamete (sperm)

Zygote at 2-cell stage, approx. 30 hours after fertilisation

Zygote at 4-cell stage, after around 40-50 hours

Zygote at 8-cell stage, after around 55 hours

Morula

Blastocyst after around 4 days

Blastocyst after around 5 days

Blastocyst after around 8-9 days

Germ cells at approx. 11th day

Germ cells at approx. 20th day

Embryo at around the end of the 1st month of pregnancy

Embryo at around the end of the 2nd month of pregnancy

An ideal model set for teaching or learning about the anatomy of reproduction.
