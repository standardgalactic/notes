The Mereological Space Ontology is a study of the parts of four-dimensional space that sorts them into a hierarchated set of categories. The term "Ocularomonoturnolamphrolamphrodynogravitoquarkoelectroleptofermiophotogluomesobosoprotoneutrobaryohadroatomoleculounicellulocrystolattissomicromegalobiogaiamatechniotellagaiaselenasolaraperinebulavacuooriocygnobrachiogalactoproximasystadavirgolaniakeasuperclustopiscescetusfilamentocytosis" refers to the formation of cell-like structures within the observable and real universe on all possible scales. The ontology includes observable space, the uniturn, dark matter, dark energy, exchange particles of gravity, weak and electromagnetic forces, elementary particles like quarks, leptons, fermions, and bosons, atoms, molecules, microbial and megalobial structures, Gaiama (the sum total of all lifeforms on the planet), Technium (the sum total of all environments), the earth-moon system, the solar system, local fluff and vacuity, the Orion-Cygnus Arm, the Milky Way Galaxy, the local group, the Virgo Supercluster, the Laniakea Supercluster, and the Pisces-Cetus Filament.

Could I get a kind of condensed version of this. 

The Mereological Space Ontology is a way of categorizing and studying the parts of space on all possible scales. It includes observable space, the universe, dark matter and energy, exchange particles like gluons and photons, atoms and molecules, and various collections of matter like crystals, microbial and megalobial structures, the biosphere, and the solar system, galaxy, and larger structures like the Virgo Supercluster.
