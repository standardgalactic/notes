The study introduces a new method called experiment directed metadynamics (EDM), which minimally biases simulations to match entire free energy surfaces. Unlike previous bias methods, which only match average values, EDM can also match radial distribution functions and phi/psi angle free energies. The method can also create a tunable mixture of the experimental data and free energy of the unbiased ensemble with explicit ratios. Importantly, EDM has been proven to be convergent, and its final bias is guaranteed to be minimal and unique. The method was tested on a variety of systems, including a Lennard-Jones fluid, an atomistic model with bioinformatics data, and a three-component electrolyte solution. The results show that EDM can effectively construct ensembles that follow a desired free energy.

The Lennard-Jones fluid is a computational model extensively utilized in computational chemistry to study intermolecular interactions. Named after John Lennard-Jones, this model incorporates the Lennard-Jones potential (also known as LJ potential or 12-6 potential) that explains the interactions between particles in the fluid, which includes repulsive and attractive force from van der Waals interactions. This model has been used in molecular dynamics simulations to examine the fluid at different temperatures and densities.

The Lennard-Jones potential uses a formula to calculate the potential energy based on the distance between particles, depth of the potential well, and size of the particle. The force exerted by the potential can be repulsive or attractive depending on the distance between particles.

An equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid, known as the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation, was derived by combining simulation results with calculated values. This equation accurately describes the behavior of the Lennard-Jones fluid over a wide range of temperatures and densities. Moreover, two- and three-body integrals (J, K, and L), which occur in perturbation theory, have been calculated under different state conditions for the Lennard-Jones fluid.

The McGovern-De Pablo method is a technique used in metadynamics simulations to correct for boundary effects in systems with finite simulation boxes. Metadynamics works by adding bias to the system to explore its free energy landscape. However, in finite simulation boxes, this can lead to boundary artifacts that distort the free energy surface. The McGovern-De Pablo method alleviates these artifacts by introducing zero-force hills near the system boundaries. These act as walls, preventing biased exploration beyond the simulation box boundaries. 

The process involves determining the system boundaries, defining boundary regions on each side of the box, introducing zero-force hills within these regions, and applying the metadynamics bias to the system as usual. When a biased simulation approaches the boundaries, the zero-force hills limit exploration in those areas. This method thus helps to mitigate excessive biasing beyond the simulation box boundaries, resulting in a more accurate representation of the system's free energy landscape.
