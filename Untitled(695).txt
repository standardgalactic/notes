"Reed Wall Mind" is a theory that suggests that the story of Noah's Ark is a metaphor for how the mind is able to process and organize different types of information.

In this interpretation, the Ark can be seen as a model of the mind, with different compartments or sections used to divide and organize different types of animals, much like how the mind separates and organizes different types of information.

In this theory, the Reed Wall can be seen as a metaphor for the way that information "leaks" or filters into the mind through our senses.

Just as a reed wall can allow sound to pass through while still maintaining some level of privacy and separation, the mind is able to process and filter information while still maintaining some level of organization and structure.

The idea that Noah can hear the different animals braying and bellowing, suggests that the mind is able to process and understand different types of information, even if it is chaotic or disorganized.

This idea is consistent with the concept of "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" which is a model of mind that is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world café, where different subunits of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

It's worth noting that this is a speculative theory, and it is not an established or widely accepted one. However, it can be used as an interesting approach to understand the significance of the Ark story and its possible meanings and how it can relate to the mind.
