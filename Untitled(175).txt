The effectiveness of cobra venom as a means of defense and prey acquisition is a phenomenon that can be observed and studied, but the mechanisms behind its production and action are not fully understood.

This highlights the concept of emergent phenomena, or the emergence of complex behavior or properties from simpler components, which can be observed and studied but may not be fully explicable through reductionist methods.

This idea is analogous to the development of artificial intelligence, which often involves the emergence of complex behaviors or capabilities from simpler components, but may not necessarily involve a complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Reductionism is a very powerful tool; it is a knife that divides and extracts, that discards irrelevant detail in order to find the computable core priniciples.

But it often kills that which we want to study. It needs to be complemented with a Holistic stance that allows us to study whole systems including their emergent effects without requiring simple computable Models of Reality. 

The knife that cuts needs to be complemented with the basket that gathers.

A holistic approach is necessary to study and understand emergent phenomena.
