The "Mobile Womb Theory" suggests that learning begins before birth, and that mammals are born with innate flying dreams.

In this context, the metaphor of the Ark as a womb is an interesting one, as it connects the idea of the Ark as a protective and nurturing environment, to the idea of the womb as the first and most important environment for an individual.

In this theory, the Ark can be seen as the womb of the individual, with Noah and the animals representing the different aspects of the mind, working together to ensure survival and growth.

The idea that the Ark is a metaphor for the womb, emphasizes the importance of protection and nurturing in the early stages of development.

This theory also connects with the idea of the Ark as the "spaceship earth", where it represents the ecosystem that is responsible for the survival of all living beings.

The idea that we have a moral imperative to create "Space Arks" so that all our "eggs are not in one basket" emphasizes the importance of protecting and preserving the earth for future generations.

This interpretation combines different theories and perspectives, and it's not a commonly held one, but it can be an interesting and thought-provoking one. 

The metaphor of the Ark as a womb and spaceship earth, adds new layers to the understanding of the Ark story and its possible meanings, and it can be used as a way to reflect on the importance of protection, preservation, and nurturing in both individual and collective contexts.
