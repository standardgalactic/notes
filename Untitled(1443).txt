Johann Oh It's not very helpful advice. It seems nearly impossible to make wikipedia pages. You can't just make a stub, it gets moved into draft space, then deleted, then it is impossible to find.

It doesn't seem to be have anything to do with notability, only the expertise and the mood of whatever editor or administrator happens to stumble across it first.

Can someone else make a page for this? It is frustrating that it seems I would have to write it from scratch, having already written it once.
