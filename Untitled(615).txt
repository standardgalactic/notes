Basal cognition and intelligence: Basal cognition refers to the fundamental cognitive processes and abilities that are present in various species. Intelligence, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of cognitive abilities, including reasoning, problem-solving, memory, and learning. Basal cognition provides the foundation upon which higher-level intelligence is built.

Buddhist philosophy and its connection to intelligence: Buddhist philosophy emphasizes the development of wisdom and understanding through practices such as meditation and mindfulness. It recognizes the potential for individuals to cultivate their intelligence by gaining insight into the nature of reality, understanding the workings of the mind, and developing compassion and empathy towards others.

Constructivist efforts in creating intelligence: Constructivism is an educational theory that suggests learners actively construct knowledge and meaning through their experiences. In the context of creating intelligence, constructivist approaches focus on providing learners with rich and interactive environments that stimulate their cognitive abilities and allow them to actively engage in problem-solving and critical thinking.

Goal-directed activity and stress reduction: Engaging in goal-directed activities can help individuals maintain focus, motivation, and a sense of purpose. By setting and working towards goals, individuals can experience a sense of accomplishment and reduce stress levels. Goal-directed activities provide structure and direction, which can contribute to overall well-being and stress reduction.

Evolution and the scaling of intelligence: Evolutionary processes have shaped the development of intelligence across species. Intelligence can be seen as an adaptive trait that allows organisms to navigate their environments, solve problems, and survive. The scaling of intelligence refers to the variations in cognitive abilities among different species and how intelligence has evolved over time.

Self and agency in relation to intelligence: The concept of self refers to an individual's sense of identity, while agency pertains to one's ability to act and exert control over their actions and decisions. Intelligence plays a role in self-awareness, self-regulation, and the ability to make choices based on one's goals and values. The development and expression of intelligence are closely tied to an individual's sense of self and their agency in the world.

Care as a central invariant in multiple fields: The notion of care is considered central in various fields, including healthcare, psychology, and education. Care involves providing support, empathy, and attention to the well-being and needs of others. It is recognized as a crucial element for fostering positive relationships, promoting growth and development, and creating nurturing environments.

Practopoiesis and the mind-body connection: Practopoiesis is a concept that highlights the reciprocal relationship between the mind and body. It emphasizes that the mind and body are interconnected and mutually influence each other's functioning. Practopoiesis suggests that cognition and intelligence are not solely confined to the brain but involve the entire embodied experience.

Axiology of love and its significance: The axiology of love refers to the study and understanding of the value and significance of love in human experiences and relationships. Love is considered a fundamental human need, and it plays a vital role in personal well-being, social connections, and emotional fulfillment. Exploring the axiology of love helps to shed light on its importance and impact on individuals and society.

Choice Theory and basic human needs: Choice Theory, developed by William Glasser, posits that humans are motivated by their basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. According to this theory, individuals make choices and behave in ways they believe will satisfy these fundamental needs. Understanding these needs can provide insights into human behavior and guide strategies for personal growth and fulfillment.

Mysticism of interiority and quietism: The mysticism of interiority refers to the exploration of the inner self and subjective experiences. It involves practices such as meditation, introspection, and contemplation, with the goal of gaining deeper insights into the nature of consciousness and the spiritual dimensions of existence. Quietism, on the other hand, is a philosophical and spiritual approach that emphasizes inner stillness, tranquility, and detachment from worldly concerns. It involves seeking peace and enlightenment through silence, solitude, and the contemplation of one's own inner being.
