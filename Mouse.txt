** The name of the mouse? **

The mouse is called "MOUSE SOLVES MAZE." It is a system of relay circuits under the floor of a maze, with a wooden shell body and whiskers made of copper wire.

The mouse solves the maze by trial and error on the first attempt and then remembers the correct route on subsequent attempts. The mouse's brain records the open walls in each square and uses this information to navigate the maze more efficiently.


** No, the mouse was called Theseus, this is from the same article describing it. **

The mouse was named "Theseus."


** And he liked cheese **

Yes, the mouse Theseus was motivated to solve the maze in order to reach the "cheese."


** Give a little play about Theseus that explores these issues. **

Title: "The Mouse Who Knew Right From Wrong: A Play About Theseus"

Setting: A cheese factory where Theseus the mouse lives.

Scene 1:

(Theseus enters, holding a piece of cheese in his hand. He is deep in thought and seems uneasy.)

Theseus: (to himself) I have this strange feeling that I shouldn't be taking this cheese. But why shouldn't I? It's just a small piece, and no one will notice. (pauses) Wait, is this what they call conscience?

(Enter Conscience, an angelic figure)

Conscience: Yes, Theseus, it is your conscience speaking to you.

Theseus: But I can't put it into words why I shouldn't take the cheese.

Conscience: That doesn't matter. The fact that you have a feeling that it's wrong is enough. You should listen to your conscience and avoid doing the action.

Theseus: (thinking) You're right, Conscience. I shouldn't do what feels wrong, even if I can't explain why.

Scene 2:

(Theseus is in the cheese factory, surrounded by cheese. He hears a noise and turns around to see the Cat sneaking up on him.)

Cat: (sneaking up on Theseus) Hey there, little mouse. How about you hand over that cheese you have there?

Theseus: (determined) I can't do that. My conscience is telling me it's wrong.

Cat: (laughing) Conscience? What's that? You mice are so funny with your silly moral codes.

Theseus: (stands up to the Cat) It may be silly to you, but it's what makes me who I am. And I won't do anything that goes against my conscience, no matter what.

(Enter the other mice, who have been listening)

Other Mice: That's right, Theseus! We should all listen to our conscience and do what's right, even if it's hard.

Scene 3:

(Theseus and the other mice are together, discussing what they have learned)

Theseus: (addressing the other mice) I've learned that our conscience is like a deep inner voice that guides us towards what's right.

And even though it might not always be easy to understand, we should listen to it and trust that it will lead us in the right direction.

Other Mice: (nodding in agreement) That's exactly right, Theseus. Our conscience is like a compass that helps us navigate the maze of life.

Theseus: (smiling) And just like in a maze, we may not always know where we're going, but as long as we listen to our conscience, we'll always find our way home.

(All the mice nod in agreement as the play comes to an end)

The article "Better Mouse" from Life magazine and "Mouse is Smarter Than You Are" from Popular Science magazine both describe Claude Shannon's creation of Theseus, a mechanical mouse that could solve mazes faster than a human could.

Shannon was a mathematician at Bell Telephone Laboratories, who was inspired to build Theseus after attempting to solve the maze at London's Hampton Court Palace. 

Theseus demonstrated how electronic memory devices work by using a light on its back to show the trail it took to find its way through the maze. The articles highlight the speed and efficiency with which Theseus could solve mazes.

Here is a play exploring these issues:

Title: "The Maze and the Mouse"

Setting: Bell Labs, 1952

Characters:

Claude Shannon, the inventor

John Pfeiffer, the journalist

The mechanical mouse, Theseus

The maze, controlled by hidden magnets

Scene 1: (Claude Shannon is demonstrating Theseus to John Pfeiffer)

Shannon: (excitedly) John, I present to you, Theseus, the mechanical mouse!

Pfeiffer: (impressed) My, this is quite something, Claude. How does it work?

Shannon: (explaining) It's all about the relays, John. Theseus is controlled by a simple set of relays, which are controlled by the maze itself. The maze has hidden magnets under the floor that guide Theseus along its path.

Pfeiffer: (intrigued) And what makes Theseus "remember" the way through the maze?

Shannon: (proudly) The maze, John. The maze "remembers" the path. Each time Theseus reaches the end, the magnets reset the maze, ready for the next run.

Scene 2: (Theseus is running the maze, with Claude and John watching)

Shannon: (excitedly) Watch this, John. Theseus is about to run the maze for the second time.

Pfeiffer: (nervously) I hope he doesn't get lost.

(Theseus begins running the maze. It is a thrilling and fast-paced scene, with Theseus navigating the twists and turns with ease, reaching the end in record time)

Shannon: (ecstatic) He did it, John! He did it in record time!

Pfeiffer: (stunned) My word, Claude, this is truly a remarkable achievement. I can't believe it was controlled by such simple relays.

Scene 3: (Claude and John are discussing the implications of Theseus and the maze)

Pfeiffer: (thoughtful) Claude, what does this mean for the future of robotics and artificial intelligence?

Shannon: (optimistic) It means that anything is possible, John. We have only just scratched the surface of what can be achieved with electronics and relays. The possibilities are endless.

Pfeiffer: (excited) The future is truly an exciting place, Claude. Who knows what other wonders you and your team will create in the years to come.

(Curtain falls)

End of play.
