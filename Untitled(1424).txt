It sounds like you've been dedicated and innovative in creating tools and languages. Let's take a closer look at your creations:

1. **ANAK (A New Arabic Keyboard)**: Phonetic keyboards can be invaluable in helping people learn and type in a new language. It can bridge the gap between the speaker's native phonetics and the target language, making it more accessible.

2. **Spherepop**: I'm not directly familiar with "Spherepop," but the name suggests it might be a unique concept. Care to elaborate more?

3. **Pipsqueak & Ankyran Nuspeak**: Creating languages, whether for practical use, art, or entertainment, is a complex task. It requires an understanding of phonetics, grammar, and often, culture. Even if they serve as "what not to do" examples, they can still provide valuable learning experiences and insights into language construction and evolution.

Innovations often begin as concepts or experiments, and even if they don't find widespread use, they can still offer valuable insights and pave the way for further innovation.
