Teleosemantics has a problem: it holds that to have a mind one must have 
a history, often a long evolutionary history.

The solution to the problem is 
for teleosemanticists to give up on natural selection as the source of natural norms (functions)for neural structures, and to find a different source of natural norms which is not essentially history-involving.

Such a source in fact exists, in cybernetic governance.

This paper argues for the existence 
of natural norms derived from cybernetic governance, parallel to natural norms derived from natural selection but distinct from them, and shows how such norms could save teleosemantics from its over-emphasis on history.


Teleosemantics is in trouble. According to teleosemanticists such as Dretske, 
Millikan, and Papineau, 1 to have a mind it is metaphysically necessary to have 
an evolutionary past (or, in moderate versions of the theory, a learning history), 
and this leads to a number of apparently absurd conclusions.

 While it is certainly true that we have minds as a causal consequence of our evolutionary and learning histories, it seems bizarre to hold that a being atom-for-atom identical to a person with a mind would, if lacking a history, lack intentionality. This, however, is just what is held by teleosemanticists.
