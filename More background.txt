In 1592, he moved to Venice and took up residence in Mocenigo's home. Mocenigo, however, over time came to believe that Bruno held heretical beliefs. (He also seemed to believe that Bruno was withholding from him knowledge of some of his most effective memory tricks--and might have been concerned that Bruno was too attracted to his wife.) He disclosed his concerns about Bruno to his father confessor, who urged him to denounce him to The Holy Office. When Bruno, on May 22, becoming uncomfortable with his situation, announced his intention to return to Germany, Mocenigo (in Bruno's own words) ordered "five or six" servants to "lift me out of my bed and carry me to the attic" of his palazzo. Locked in the attic, Bruno was told by Mocenigo that unless he revealed his secrets for memorizing words "something unpleasant would happen" to him. Bruno, in his account, replied "I had taught him enough and more than I was obliged to, and that I did not deserve to be treated like this." The next day, Mocenigo reported Bruno to civil authorities, who in turn delivered him to the Inquisition.

Mocenigo, in a three-page letter to the Inquisition made a long series of accusations against Bruno. In his letter, Mocenigo claimed to have heard Bruno say, "while conversing in my home, that it is a great blasphemy for the Catholics to say that bread transmutes the flesh, that he is an enemy of the Mass, and that Christ is a wretch." The letter, written in the shaky hand of an infuriated man, also claimed Bruno "revealed plans to make himself the head of a new sect under the name of a new philosophy, that the Virgin could not have given birth, ...that our Catholic opinions are the teaching of asses,...and that he marvels that God can bear such heresies of Catholics." The letter ends: "And I reverently kiss the hand of your Reverend Paternity. At home, May 23, 1592."
