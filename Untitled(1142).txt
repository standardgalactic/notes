In the next paper, Chiara Ferella argues that the debated term μουνογενές, one of Parmenides’ attributes of what-is (DK 8,4 modified according to Simplicius’ text) is an echo of the Orphic line quoted by the DA at col. XVI.6 (αὐτὸς δ᾽ ἄρα μοῦ̣νος ἔγεντο). On the basis of this parallel, she favors the interpretation of μουνογενές as a compound from the verb γίγνεσθαι (rather than from the noun γένος) and argues that the word means “being the only one”, in the sense that, like the Orphic Zeus-μοῦνος, Parmenides’ what-is is “all-embracing”. This paper provides yet another plausible illustration of the relationship between the Orphic poem and pre-Socratic philosophy, not to mention a great amount of material for experts on Parmenides to debate.
