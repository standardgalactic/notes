I  hope this doesn't across as petty and it's been over a year, but I tried to write out the list of logical operators from memory and I accidentally came across the same issue that made me want to try to update those images in the first place. I'm trying to make them more memorable

and (eventually) easier to type, the bar over the letters is a mistake as a way to negate them I still think the bar with a crook on it is better, since it could be approximated by a ~ or a - for example, and thinking of how to type a macron easily and that it means not is more difficult.

Likewise the the circle with a cross through it is already overloaded it's the old symbol for earth and sometimes used as a function applicator. So I think it should look exactly like the if and only if sign, the double arrow.
