SECTION 7:

Oblique methods are approaches that involve indirect or unconventional methods of achieving a goal.

These methods can be used in a variety of fields, including science, art, and problem-solving.

They often involve finding creative solutions to problems or making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas.

Oblique methods can be powerful tools for generating new ideas and solving complex problems.

** An acrostic poem about oblique methods, spelling out "Model-Free Zoo" **

Many methods exist beyond the typical models and formulas
Oblique approaches offer alternative ways to solve problems
Discovery, trial and error, and adaptation are just a few
Emergent phenomena can be studied without reduction
Learning and recognition can occur without symbols or logic

Failures and successes can be remembered and applied
Real systems and their effects can be studied without a model
Experience and interaction shape innate knowledge and understanding
Everything from cobras to humans use model-free methods to navigate the world

Zigzagging paths, not straightforward
Outsiders may find them bizarre
Opening doors to new solutions
