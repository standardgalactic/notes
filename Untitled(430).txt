Perfecting Our Instruments

Perhaps this Is A Novel hypOthesis.

That they built giant lithophones.

I guess another implication of what I'm saying is that those mysterious stalagmite structures found in the Bruniquel cave are probably prehistoric "pianos".

Perhaps stalagmites broken off at different lengths make different tones and several of them are played simultaneously, by multiple teams.

There are a few experiments that could be done to see if this a viable hypothesis.

Someone else has probably written more eloquently about this, and in more detail; I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person to think of this. 

Now there’s a thought

When asked if there were any musical instruments in the cave, Richard Steven Walz on Quora said:

Yes. Some items resembling a flute, and in caves with their remains are found stalactites and stalagmites broken off to musical scales of some kind.

But he didn't mention where he learned this.
