A view at the role and place of religion, metaphysics and
science of philosophy_as a social consciousness integrators belong
to O.Cont. However, his merit is not that he discovered them; these
forms of collective consciousness had been well known before him.
They were formulated by Turgot. Cont's contribution to the theory
of the social world is that he proposed to consider them as a raw
material for the creation of the social fabric.
So, at first the myths then philosophical system played the role
of the collective intelligence integrators.

The monograph exposes the social form of the universum’s movement as the 
holistic process of the living matter self-expansion. It scrutinizes the world-view 
and ideological bases of the process of comprehension of a field form of life as 
well as the quality of methodological toolkit applied to the study of the 
noosociogenesis theory. 
In the course of the epistemological analysis the quantum-wave nature of 
social relations, essence, substance and form of social life are being consecutively 
revealed. Simultaneously it is shown that the person is not only a source of the 
social form of the universum’s movement, but also that by beginning the interaction with a society at the macrolevel, an individual creates the organic 
integrity – the social organism. Thus, further insights into the place and the role of the second nature in the universum’s self-movement is provided. 
The book is intended for the researchers of social process, university 
professors, postgraduates, students and for all those who are interested in the problems of the noosociogenesis as an inherent part of the cosmogenesis.
