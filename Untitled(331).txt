In establishing an epistemology of phenomenology, some of the most important ontological constructs are:

Intentionality: the idea that consciousness is directed towards an object or phenomenon.

Subjectivity: the focus on the subjective experience of the individual as the starting point of inquiry.

Embodiment: the idea that consciousness is embodied and that our experiences are shaped by our physical and sensory interactions with the world.

Lifeworld: the practical and pre-reflective background of everyday experiences and activities that 

provide the framework for conscious experiences.

Horizon: the implicit and indefinite possibilities for interpretation that accompany each conscious experience.

These constructs are important for understanding how we can gain knowledge about the world through our conscious experiences and how our experiences are shaped by the world and our bodies.
