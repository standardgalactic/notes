A shorter alternative for expressing "building a second brain" in Latin could be "aedificans alterum cerebrum." This phrase translates to "building another brain" or "constructing a second brain."

I apologize for the oversight. The correct translation for "building a second brain" with the inclusion of the letter "n" in Latin would be "Aedificans Cerebrum Secundum."
