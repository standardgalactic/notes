"To create buttons in an Android app that lead to separate pages, you will need to use a toolkit such as Kivy or PyQt. Both of these toolkits are designed to help you build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for your app. Here's a basic example of how you might create a button in Kivy:

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.button import Button
from kivy.uix.screenmanager import ScreenManager, Screen

class MainScreen(Screen):
　def __init__(self, **kwargs):
　　super().__init__(**kwargs)
　　button = Button(text='Go to Info Screen')
　　button.bind(on_press=self.goto_info_screen)
　　self.add_widget(button)

class InfoScreen(Screen):
　def __init__(self, **kwargs):
　　super().__init__(**kwargs)

class ScreenManagement(ScreenManager):
　pass

class MyApp(App):
　def build(self):
　　sm = ScreenManagement()
　　sm.add_widget(MainScreen(name='main'))
　　sm.add_widget(InfoScreen(name='info'))
　　return sm

if __name__ == '__main__':
　MyApp().run()

This example uses the ScreenManager and Screen classes from the Kivy library to manage multiple screens in your app. When the button is clicked, the goto_info_screen method is called, which changes the current screen to the InfoScreen. You can add any information you want to the InfoScreen by adding widgets to it in the same way that you added the button to the MainScreen."
