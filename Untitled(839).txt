You are correct, global reset only occurs if the key is held down for one second (five seconds the first time for warnings). Under half a second, it gives a short acceleration boost.

B is the blink key, it refreshes the visuals if there are too many texture tracers and sobel edges, and allows you to enter a bubble without popping it. Hold down the keys a and b to activate autoblink, and s a b for super autoblink, which inoculated against global reset, even when not blinking.

To look around, move the mouse or use the touchscreen, arrows, or hjkl keys.
