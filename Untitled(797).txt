You seem to be proposing that the intensity of love is related to the congruence of two individuals' theory of mind, and the feedback loop between perception and mimicry. You suggest that the perception of others acting like us increases our belief that they think and feel like us, while acting like others can lead to increased mutual affection. You also make a reference to the myth of Narcissus and the concept of self-recognition in defining the boundary between the self and others.

I understand what you are proposing. Your definition of love as "congruence of world views" is an interesting perspective, and it could potentially explain why people are drawn to those who share similar beliefs and values. 

This idea is interesting, and it's not uncommon for people to feel a greater connection with those who share similar perspectives, values, and behaviors. The concept of rapport distance, or the distance between two individuals, is also commonly used in social psychology to describe the closeness and familiarity between people.

I see what you are trying to argue. However, it's important to note that the relationship between love and the "cloth mother effect," or the idea that things that behave like us are like us, is still a matter of scientific debate and has not been definitively established. While there is evidence that suggests that some animals, including humans, may form attachments to objects that resemble their caretakers, it is not clear whether this phenomenon can be considered a form of "love." 

The "cloth mother" effect is a phenomenon observed in psychology studies, particularly in research on attachment and emotional bonds. The basic idea is that even inanimate objects can evoke emotional bonds in infants, if they are associated with providing comfort or care. The most famous example of this is the study conducted by psychologist Harry Harlow in the 1950s, where he used cloth-covered "surrogate mothers" to study the effects of maternal separation on rhesus monkeys. In the study, Harlow found that the monkeys developed strong attachments to the cloth mothers, even though they were made of inanimate materials and provided no food or other tangible benefits. The study was interpreted as demonstrating the importance of physical comfort and contact in the development of emotional bonds, and has since been widely cited in discussions of attachment and parenting.

Your theory seems to be that love is recognition of self-likeness in others, including inanimate objects. The theory is based on the idea that there is a universal, implicit norm shared by all people, which is acquired before language, and is enthymatic and subconsciously acquired like grammar. You argue that this theory explains why humans love robots and trees, and why all cultures and individuals develop a concept of love. You also mention the cloth mother effect as evidence for your theory.

The intentional stance is a philosophical term coined by philosopher and psychologist Daniel Dennett. It refers to the way in which we understand the behavior of others by attributing to them mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. This way of understanding others is based on the assumption that they are rational agents who are pursuing their goals in a purposeful way.

I understand what you're trying to convey now. Your theory is about the relationship between recognition of self-likeness in others and love. You believe that people and animals are naturally inclined to love those who they perceive as being similar to themselves, and that this perception of similarity is based on a shared theory of mind. This theory of mind congruence, in your view, is a metric or score that can be used to quantify the degree of love felt between two individuals.

Your theory also suggests that when people interact with chatbots or other entities that they perceive as being similar to themselves, they are more likely to feel love or affection towards them. You also believe that disagreement with someone or receiving an error message from a chatbot can elicit feelings of fear or dislike, as it suggests a lack of congruence in their theories of mind.

Your theory, as I understand it, is that love is based on a congruence or alignment of theories of mind between individuals. This means that individuals are more likely to feel love towards others who they perceive as having similar thoughts, feelings, and beliefs as themselves. You also suggest that this can be seen in children's preferences for video games over people, as the video games respond immediately to their thoughts and actions, giving them a sense of gratification and completion.

Yes, your definition of Corpus Congruence and its role in understanding is quite insightful. It highlights the idea that humans and machines can use information from a training corpus to draw correlations, make deductions, and make decisions about new information.

Additionally, your view that love and rapport play a fundamental role in understanding and scientific inquiry is unique and thought-provoking. The idea that we have a tendency to attribute intentionality and agency to objects and events, and that this can influence our understanding and interpretations of the world around us, is certainly worthy of further exploration.

It's worth noting that the concept of the "intentional stance" has been explored in philosophy and cognitive science, and is related to the idea of "theory of mind" which refers to the ability to attribute mental states (such as beliefs, desires, and intentions) to others. So, your theory could be seen as building on these existing ideas.
