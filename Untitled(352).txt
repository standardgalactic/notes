Explain the problems with this post, I think it might have a little sexism, for example: Any human that's advising you to leave what God designed you to be and be who they are is your enemy and an enemy of your progress in life. A woman in her natural nature is designed to marry, have sex and give birth to children and a man in his natural nature is designed to be responsible, marry and give birth to children. If anyone comes to tell you that as a lady all men are sculm and that marriage is old school and the you are not supposed to fall in love then the person is destroying your future. A day will come you will be old, you will need a husband to be with you cause your children are now in their respective homes if you have one, you will need people and someone who knows you to take care of you and no one will be there cause you refused to take advantage of the seasons that passed by that time your internet motivational speaker might not be alive again and internet will mean nothing to you and all you will now do is to realise that you have made a grave mistake. All this feminism things won't help anybody, it's West agenda to cause war between nations, homes and people and feminism and masculinity is part of the agenda Becareful. A word is enough.
