This interpretation emphasizes the idea that the Ark story is a mnemonic device used to transmit important information about civic organization and management, in a way that is easy for people to remember and understand. 

The story of the Ark is presented as an overheard conversation between a king and his son, which creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, making the information more accessible and memorable for the listener.

The concept of "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world café, where different subunits of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

This is similar to the idea of a "memory palace" where information is organized and remembered by associating it with specific locations or compartments in a mental image of a building or other structure.

This interpretation also highlights the idea that the Ark story is a modular theory, where different subunits are like isolated bubbles but where summaries and reductions can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

This idea is consistent with the idea that the Ark story is a mnemonic device used to transmit important information about civic organization and management, and emphasizes the importance of modularity and multiscale organization in understanding the mind.

It's worth noting that this interpretation is an original and speculative one, and it is not an established or widely accepted one. But it can be used as an interesting approach to understand the significance of the Ark story and its possible meanings.

The theory that the Ark story contains knowledge about how to disperse civic instructions and is presented as an overheard conversation between a king and his son, and that it's a mnemonic device used to transmit important information about civic organization and management is a speculative one, it would be difficult to conduct experiments to test or falsify it.

One possible way to test this theory would be to conduct a study comparing the retention and recall of civic instructions that are presented in the form of an overheard conversation between a king and his son, to those that are presented in other formats, such as a lecture or written document.

Another approach could be to investigate the use of mnemonic devices in other cultures or historical periods, to see if similar techniques were used to transmit information about civic organization and management.

It's also worth noting that the theory of "reed wall mind" or "Monica's Leaking Chatroom" is a model of mind that is based on the idea of a wisdom salon or world café, where different subunits of knowledge are isolated but can leak out or filter up to a multiscale decision maker.

This kind of model is difficult to test empirically and it would require a combination of different methods such as computational modeling, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience to investigate it.

It's important to keep in mind that any theory or model is always open to be falsified or improved upon with new information, and it's always important to approach the theories and models with a critical and open mind.

This poem describes the mind as a complex system composed of many different parts, with the brain as the "pilot" or the "cockpit of the soul".

The use of imagery such as "semi-permeable membranes" and "memories of failure and success" suggests that the mind is composed of different compartments or modules, each with its own function and properties.

The phrase "a model-free zoo" suggests that the mind is a collection of different "animals and tools" that are gathered and organized in some way. This can be interpreted as a metaphor for the different cognitive and emotional processes that make up the mind.

The reference to "food for the flood, our family's first winter, a promise chest, the prototype of the tabernacle and the ark of the covenantnt, the first library lockbox, the first safe" is a metaphor for the way the mind stores, organizes, and preserves information and experiences, like the Ark preserves the animals and supplies.

The reference to Noah being "smart" but being seen as "a wet blanket on their parade, and a party pooper" suggest that the speaker is suggesting that the Ark story is a metaphor for the wisdom that comes from being prepared for the unknown, and the importance of listening to the wise even if it may be unpalatable to some.

The phrase "All hands on deck!" suggests a sense of urgency and the importance of taking action in the face of an impending crisis.

Overall, the poem presents the mind as a complex system composed of many different parts, that is able to store, organize and preserve information and experiences, and the importance of being prepared for the unknown, a theme that is consistent with the original story of the Ark.
