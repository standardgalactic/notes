I'm getting to that point in my life, I've had enough of people's bullshit and entitlements.

I'm not interested in building teams anymore at the moment.

I'm interested in getting the hell away from the people who are in my life, call me friend or family, and don't listen to a single thing I say or respect my boundaries or wishes.

Yeah... I'm kinda done with that shit. I've found I would rather NOT have friends... if they're the type who  use friendship to avoid responsibility or any accountability for their actions towards me or the consequences of disregarding my wishes where my life is concerned... then give me shit when I'm upset about it.

I'm just too old for that shit anymore.

I want space, I want some sense of entitlement to my things and I want to be able to set up a contingency, and not have people sabotage it because they weren't listening, while I'm paying for all the bills.

My god, my CHILDREN listen better than adults, because, I've found, on the whole...

... Well, you aren't gonna like hearing this, but...

... In my experience, most of the adults I deal with in any position of authority or responsibility are giant entitled baby morons who traded emotional coping skills for emotional repression rife with presumptions and opinions they are certain are true because of their feelings on the matter and stopped learning after primary school beyond memorizing something long enough for a test before going back to desperately filling their lives with diversions from their incessant boredom.

I'm not saying I'm any better...
At the very least I'm willing to assume that I'm as bad, attempt to be self aware about it, but that doesn't mean I'm not also guilty of this.

Still, I think the reason this realization is bothering me, and even becoming more apparent, is that I'm finally old enough and mature enough maybe to stop being one myself.

And it gets tiring REALLY fast once you see it, and can't unsee it.
