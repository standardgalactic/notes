Biography

Mathematician known for work on geometry of polytopes.

Petrie married and had a daughter. Then, at the end of 1972, his wife suffered a sudden heart attack and died. He missed her so much and was so distracted, that he walked to a highway near his house and, when trying to cross it, he was hit by a car.
