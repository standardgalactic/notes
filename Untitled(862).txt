Hello, I just saw your article on AI aligment. I am an artist and home renovator from New Brunswick, Canada. 

It looks like I have been writing "essays" or "dialogues" on some of these topics, however they are all over the place and I doubt I have any readers.

Most likely I will need more computational resources to continue organizing my ideas and to make them more succinct and coherent. 

There is a lot of science fiction mixed in, but maybe there is already something useful for your research already. 

Feel free to steal any of my ideas if they are of any use to you.
