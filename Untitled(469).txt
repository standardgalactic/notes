"I think of myself as a science fiction writer — and I define science fiction as stories set in the future. The future is big, and that’s why science fiction has a variety of subgenres within it. If you’re 5 million years in the future, then it’s kind of a fantasy space, and that’s what people often think of when they think of science fiction. And then there’s near-future science fiction … a kind of a realism of our time, but you push a few elements.

"I myself have occupied an in-between zone, like 100 to 300 years in the future. That’s an interesting and underutilized time zone in science fiction. But, in thinking about climate fiction, I was thinking there’s no reason to write about “later on.” It’s happening now. And I wanted to try describing the next three decades or so going as well as you could possibly believe in.

"I wanted to do a best case scenario, so that people can see that although we are in extreme danger right now … there’s the potential for good results."
