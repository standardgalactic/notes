One half of square root of (five squared plus ten squared) times the other side however much you scaled up that side to find the area of the second triangle.

To understand and solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the square root of the sum of \(5^2\) and \(10^2\).

2. Multiply the result by one half to represent one side of a triangle.

3. Scale up the other side by the same factor to find the area of a second triangle.

### Step 1: Calculate the square root

First, we calculate the square root of \(5^2 + 10^2\). This gives us the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of lengths 5 and 10.

### Step 2: Multiply by one half

This step seems to indicate we should consider the resulting value as one side of a triangle. However, multiplying by one half usually refers to the formula for the area of a triangle (\(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\)), which might be a misunderstanding in the question.

### Step 3: Scale up the other side and find the area of a second triangle

This step suggests scaling up one side of a triangle to find the area of a second, larger triangle. Without a specific scaling factor or additional details on how the sides are being scaled, we'll proceed with the calculation from the first step to clarify the request.

Let's start by calculating the square root of \(5^2 + 10^2\) to get the hypotenuse length.

import math

# Calculate the square root of 5^2 + 10^2
hypotenuse_length = math.sqrt(5**2 + 10**2)
hypotenuse_length

The square root of \(5^2 + 10^2\) is approximately 11.18. This value can be considered the length of one side of a triangle, specifically the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs of lengths 5 and 10.

However, the question's latter part about scaling up the other side to find the area of a second triangle is a bit unclear without specifying how much to scale up the side or which triangle we are referring to.

If you meant to apply this length as a side of another triangle to calculate its area or if there's a specific scaling factor or additional context, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.

The original triangle was 5 by 10 the second right triangle is attached to its hypotenuse so its second is bigger than five by the same ratio as the hypotenuse is to the 10 side

Given the clarification, we have a right triangle with sides of 5 and 10, and its hypotenuse has been calculated as approximately 11.18. We are then looking at a second right triangle that shares the hypotenuse of the first triangle as one of its legs. The other leg of this second triangle is longer than 5, scaled up by the same ratio as the hypotenuse is to the original 10 side.

The scaling factor for the hypotenuse to the original 10 side is \(\frac{11.18}{10}\). We'll apply this ratio to scale up the 5 side for the second triangle.

Let's calculate:

1. The scaling factor based on the hypotenuse and the original 10 side.

2. The length of the scaled-up side that was originally 5.

3. The area of the second triangle, using the hypotenuse as one leg and the scaled-up side as the other leg, knowing that the area formula for a right triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\), where base and height are the legs of the triangle.

# Scaling factor
scaling_factor = hypotenuse_length / 10

# Calculate the length of the scaled-up side (originally 5)
scaled_up_side = 5 * scaling_factor

# Calculate the area of the second triangle
area_second_triangle = 0.5 * hypotenuse_length * scaled_up_side
(scaling_factor, scaled_up_side, area_second_triangle)

The scaling factor, based on the hypotenuse to the original 10 side, is approximately 1.118. Using this factor, the length of the side originally 5 in the second triangle is scaled up to approximately 5.59.

The area of the second triangle, with the hypotenuse of approximately 11.18 as one leg and the scaled-up side of approximately 5.59 as the other leg, is about 31.25 square units.
