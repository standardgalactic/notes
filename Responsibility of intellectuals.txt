 
So what's the responsibility of intellectuals?

Always the same: find the structures of power that are illegitimate, undermine them in your scholarship, in your activism, work with others, bring the message as best you can to others, help them come to understand it.

That's the responsibility of intellectuals.

The task changes as the institutions change.

â€” Noam Chomsky, Practical Utopias
