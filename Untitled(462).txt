Research Question 
In an earlier experimental study, we found a signif i cant increase in the use of visual and formal repre- 
sentations among students in the experimental group but not in the control group (Bronkhorst etÂ al., 
2020b). In the experimental group, the use of Venn and Euler diagrams positively correlated with the 
scores on closed tasks. We also found that, in the post-test, students from the experimental group used 
Venn and Euler diagrams much more frequently than symbolic logical rules. In this article, the focus 
is on student development through the dif f erent modes of representation in the classroom. We focus 
on the way students developed ef f ective use of visual and formal representations over the course of 
the intervention. In evaluating student development during the dif f erent parts of our intervention, our 
study was guided by the following research question: How do students use and apply visual and formal 
representations (iconic and symbolic) in logical reasoning tasks?
