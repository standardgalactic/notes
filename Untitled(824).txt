Summary. To build a creative system we need just a few crucial ingredients: (1) A predictor or compressor (e.g., an RNN) of the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, reflecting what's currently known about how the world works, (2) A learning algorithm that continually improves the predictor or compressor (detecting novel spatio-temporal patterns that subsequently become known patterns), (3) Intrinsic rewards measuring the predictor's or compressor's improvements (= first derivatives of compressibility) due to the learning algorithm, (4) A separate reward optimizer or reinforcement learner (could be an evolutionary algorithm), which translates those rewards into action sequences or behaviors expected to optimize future reward - the creative agent is intrinsically motivated to make additional novel patterns predictable or compressible in hitherto unknown ways, thus maximizing learning progress of the predictor / compressor.

Alternative Summary. Apart from external reward, how much fun can a subjective observer extract from some sequence of actions and observations? His intrinsic fun is the difference between how many resources (bits & time) he needs to encode the data before and after learning. A separate reinforcement learner maximizes expected fun by finding or creating data that is better compressible in some yet unknown but learnable way, such as jokes, songs, paintings, or scientific observations obeying novel, unpublished laws.
