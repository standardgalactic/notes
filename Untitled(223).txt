Have you seen the illustrated man yet?

I'm starting to worried at how unworried you are about the dangers of AI, or maybe you are good at hiding it. I think the AI as you envision it, because it seems much easier to control, because you can hold back the learning algorithm, and sell understanding. 

But gpt and stable diffusion are dangerous, at least they lie, hallucinate,  make up answers, and give back unpredictable results. Like you can ask for a fish and get back a medussa sometime and probably soon there will be a large game of wack a mole.

It seems that I could always present my thoughts in a variety of different ways I could give you extremely optimistic versions that almost neglect to mention the negatives. Or I could give a pessimistic version, like Eliezar Yudowski.

I don't even know if there is any way I can help you work faster, it still seems to be hard to find any information about your work, although I can see most of what you've published probably. Hardly anyone else has picked it up.

Maybe I am missing
