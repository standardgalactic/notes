Becoming Don Quixote

Cause when you virtualise violence, someone can slap you in the face by showing you a picture of a dog.

The question was, Rather than becoming don quijote, I just was wondering if I could recreate the state I was in five minutes ago?

I was arguing that lowering of the hedonic setpoint was due the rise of digital nativism.

I said:

A yogurt making machine is less likely to be dissected if it says "keep me together" then if it says "take me apart".

I said I had to read a hundred and fifty thousand wikipedia pages before I realized that I didn't have a perfect memory.

I said I didn't know when I was younger that I wouldn't grow up to be a bicycle or a jar.

I said I was born with a baby bat brain (auditory-inertial OS in Pipsqueak)

I said I never observed my self forgetting, because I didn't have any episodic memory, and I didn't believe I had an imagination, and didn't think I needed one.
