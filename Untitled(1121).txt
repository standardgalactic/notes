I think we're getting to the point that

normal porn has gotten really sick that

if you're not approved about

eroticism um some of the things that

you're seeing pushed have to do with the

fact that our brains are now habituated

to all sorts of things that you probably

would never have seen visually unless

you were like gingas

K right because everything's on demand

and so the search for novelty uh I think

is taking in some cases quite a dark

term even for people who are pretty okay

with the idea of pornography and

eroticism as being a an important part

of an adult diet for the Mind where

where it worries me as kids for sure and

I'm maybe even less worried about today

than I am in 15 years when you have VR

that is bordering on Photo realistic and

that's where Photoshop whoever you want

in you know choose your own experience

that's very disturbing but I I'll be

honest I'm more concerned right now

about um people

finding Partners to have children with I

think that this is a an economic

epidemic that we don't feel comfortable

talking about and why AR people

comfortable talking about well because

for example if you have a fair idea that

you're at risk for not having the family

thing work out like it's gotten a little

late in the day and you don't see a lot

of prospects lined up and you've had a

few relationships that haven't ended in

commitment and resources in children and

the economy doesn't seem to want to come

up with a 30-year plan to fit a morgage

and getting some kids through college um

I think that the transition from the

previous world has been pretty brutal

and a lot of people don't want to say

yeah I really want a family and if it

doesn't work out I'm going to be it's

going to be a major hit to my life and

my sense of myself and we need you know

in part I think that a lot of us don't

want to see um young women forced onto

the apps you know which seems like it

turns life into this ever from a dating

perspective yeah like a sing it's just

you know somebody somebody said this is

a singles bar in my pocket and wherever

I'm board I just go to the singles bar

and start swiping and I thought okay and

how do you feel about he said well the

aggregate I feel pretty terrible about

that but I can't stop and so now you've

commodified all of this stuff and I

don't think it's a good deal for young

women at

all um I think that you know young women

have been used to putting men through

their paces and demanding a lot and you

know saying you know jump this high and

seeing who can clear the bar and when

that power is not present and when men

can't win

these competitions and have those

competitions really mean something we

derange as a society because Society is

about continuity and continuity is about

babies so no matter what you want to do

you can take it away from babies I

remember um I was talking to a young

woman who was like 26 or something and

she asked me if I had kids and I said

yes and I said do you have kids and she

like practically spit out her beer like

what and I thought do you think it's

really the crazy question that I would

ask a 26-year-old woman woman if she had

kids um and then you know she thought

about it it just feel felt very remote

and this is the economy that would

bething to people and my belief is is

that if the median individual cannot

count on being able to you know have a

home in a reasonable city that has lots

of jobs so that if one job doesn't work

they can switch and one person can stay

home doesn't have to be the dad doesn't

have to be a mom and a dad can any pair

but you need some somebody with the

freedom to stay home to raise children

while somebody else can be counted upon

to go be the bread winner in an economy

that isn't you know absolutely Razor's

Edge this is nuts and you know was

driven home to me recently my father

turned 85 we were at a party for his

friends and some of their closest

friends lived in in our neighborhood

when I was growing up they were saying

oh yes you know when we moved in all

those years ago so um there were 14 boys

who used to play on the street and now

there are none oh and I said what do you

mean there are none she said what young

families can't afford to live on the

street and I said do you have any

thought in your mind that that was a

catastrophe that happened to your street

and that maybe your generation had some

responsibility this is the silent

generation so before the baby had

something to do to say hey maybe this is

not good for society if Young amilies

she said well these homes are perfect

for families I said but you just told me

that there are no families on your

street so this is an epidemic and this

is deranging us and this is a lot of

what's behind this kind of sense of

Injustice and people trying to

um find groups I think to take care of

because you have got a lot of maternal

instincts that are not grounding in

happy hopeful homes raising kids
