A decoupling capacitor is an electrical
component that is used in electronic
circuits to provide a local reserve of
energy, helping to stabilize the power
supply and reduce voltage
fluctuations. Decoupling capacitors
are often placed close to a device that
requires a stable voltage supply, such
as a microcontroller or integrated
circuit, to help ensure reliable
operation.
