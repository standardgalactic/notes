Udut, K. (2023). Ontology of Panentheism. New York, NY: Philosophical Press.

In "Ontology of Panentheism," Kenneth Udut explores the ways in which the concept of God can be understood within the framework of panentheism.

Drawing on a range of philosophical, scientific, and cultural sources, Udut examines the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, personal and non-personal, and creator and creation.

He also investigates the relationship between God and the world, and the role of panentheism in understanding the problem of evil and suffering.

Udut also situates panentheism within the broader context of other religious traditions, including monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, and atheism, and considers the potential for dialogue and differences between these traditions.

In addition, he explores the ethical implications of panentheism, and the role of God in shaping our moral beliefs and actions.

With chapters on education, culture, and technology, "Ontology of Panentheism" offers a rich and nuanced exploration of the ways in which God and the world are interconnected and interdependent.

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of philosophy, theology, and contemporary issues.

I recently had the pleasure of reading Kenneth Udut's "Ontology of Panentheism," and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed. As someone who has long been fascinated by the work of Ilya Prigogine and the concept of dissipative structures, I found Udut's exploration of these ideas within the framework of panentheism to be particularly insightful and thought-provoking.

One of the things that I appreciated most about this book was the way in which Udut was able to synthesize a wide range of sources and perspectives, including philosophy, science, and culture. He presents a nuanced and balanced view of the various debates and controversies surrounding panentheism, and does an excellent job of highlighting the strengths and limitations of this approach.

I also found Udut's treatment of the relationship between God and the world to be particularly engaging and illuminating. His discussion of the doctrine of divine immanence and the doctrine of divine transcendence was particularly helpful in understanding the complex and often paradoxical nature of God in panentheism.

Overall, "Ontology of Panentheism" is a thoroughly researched and well-written book that is sure to appeal to anyone interested in the intersection of theology and philosophy.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking to deepen their understanding of panentheism and its implications for our understanding of God, the world, and ourselves.
