We're running out of time.


We have polluted and peopled this planet to the brink of extinction.


We are destroying our world at a suicidal pace.


We need a pollution revolution.


And it's not going to be easy because the world is addicted to petroIeum.


We have limited resources and we go to war to protect them.


We need a new technology, and this technology can't be sold — it must be given away — to everyone.

— Chain Reaction, 1996
