I think we're getting to the point that

normal porn has gotten really sick that

if you're not approved about

eroticism um some of the things that

you're seeing pushed have to do with the

fact that our brains are now habituated

to all sorts of things that you probably

would never have seen visually unless

you were like gingas

K right because everything's on demand

and so the search for novelty uh I think

is taking in some cases quite a dark

term even for people who are pretty okay

with the idea of pornography and

eroticism as being a an important part

of an adult diet for the Mind where

where it worries me as kids for sure and

I'm maybe even less worried about today

than I am in 15 years when you have VR

that is bordering on Photo realistic and

that's where Photoshop whoever you want

in you know choose your own experience

that's very disturbing but I I'll be

honest I'm more concerned right now

about um people

finding Partners to have children with I

think that this is a an economic

epidemic that we don't feel comfortable

talking about and why AR people

comfortable talking about well because

for example if you have a fair idea that

you're at risk for not having the family

thing work out like it's gotten a little

late in the day and you don't see a lot

of prospects lined up and you've had a

few relationships that haven't ended in

commitment and resources in children and

the economy doesn't seem to want to come

up with a 30-year plan to fit a morgage

and getting some kids through college um

I think that the transition from the

previous world has been pretty brutal

and a lot of people don't want to say

yeah I really want a family and if it

doesn't work out I'm going to be it's

going to be a major hit to my life and

my sense of myself and we need you know

in part I think that a lot of us don't

want to see um young women forced onto

the apps you know which seems like it

turns life into this ever from a dating

perspective yeah like a sing it's just

you know somebody somebody said this is

a singles bar in my pocket and wherever

I'm board I just go to the singles bar

and start swiping and I thought okay and

how do you feel about he said well the

aggregate I feel pretty terrible about

that but I can't stop and so now you've

commodified all of this stuff and I

don't think it's a good deal for young

women at

all um I think that you know young women

have been used to putting men through

their paces and demanding a lot and you

know saying you know jump this high and

seeing who can clear the bar and when

that power is not present and when men

can't win

these competitions and have those

competitions really mean something we

derange as a society because Society is

about continuity and continuity is about

babies so no matter what you want to do

you can take it away from babies I

remember um I was talking to a young

woman who was like 26 or something and

she asked me if I had kids and I said

yes and I said do you have kids and she

like practically spit out her beer like

what and I thought do you think it's

really the crazy question that I would

ask a 26-year-old woman woman if she had

kids um and then you know she thought

about it it just feel felt very remote

and this is the economy that would

bething to people and my belief is is

that if the median individual cannot

count on being able to you know have a

home in a reasonable city that has lots

of jobs so that if one job doesn't work

they can switch and one person can stay

home doesn't have to be the dad doesn't

have to be a mom and a dad can any pair

but you need some somebody with the

freedom to stay home to raise children

while somebody else can be counted upon

to go be the bread winner in an economy

that isn't you know absolutely Razor's

Edge this is nuts and you know was

driven home to me recently my father

turned 85 we were at a party for his

friends and some of their closest

friends lived in in our neighborhood

when I was growing up they were saying

oh yes you know when we moved in all

those years ago so um there were 14 boys

who used to play on the street and now

there are none oh and I said what do you

mean there are none she said what young

families can't afford to live on the

street and I said do you have any

thought in your mind that that was a

catastrophe that happened to your street

and that maybe your generation had some

responsibility this is the silent

generation so before the baby had

something to do to say hey maybe this is

not good for society if Young amilies

she said well these homes are perfect

for families I said but you just told me

that there are no families on your

street so this is an epidemic and this

is deranging us and this is a lot of

what's behind this kind of sense of

Injustice and people trying to

um find groups I think to take care of

because you have got a lot of maternal

instincts that are not grounding in

happy hopeful homes raising kids that's

really interesting what do you think is

um the sort of key driver is this uh

student loans is it um the average

salary isn't going up like and part of

the what drives my question is I know

what I pay so my my previous company I

had at 1 Point 3,000 employees about

1500 full-time and then another 1500

part-time here I have 20 plus employees

full-time and then another I don't know

seven or eight part-time and I know what

I pay them and it's it's a good wage um

it's a hell of a lot more than I was

making at their age that's probably the

easiest way to say it okay

so where is it that just the way that we

are and what we pay is not indicative of

what other companies pay is it um is it

something else is this it's just going

to be um really kind of brutal first of

all uh we we're in an orchard with lots

of lwh hanging scientific fruit where

you could take the scientific fruit and

turn it into technology in short order

we're still making scientific advances

but most of those that are even fairly

profound are not instantly convertible

into technology so there might be lwh

hanging fruit in a new Orchard but we

haven't found the new Orchard so we're

picking fruit that has a very different

characteristic so that's the first part

is that our pipeline got screwed up but

how does that really play out in like

dollars and cents so I'm thinking of

this street right it's the Perfect

Analogy so you have a street the houses

have a price to buy they have a price to

rent so when I think about okay what is

stopping somebody from either buying or

renting so if the prices are too high

prices are too high so then is it that

the prices are artificially too high

because we have a bunch of empty houses

and people who are buying as an

investment and they're just being stupid

so you're fairly familiar with my

theories and acronyms and things so you

you've probably heard about the embedded

growth obligation the ego but what I I

and I get that and that scares me and I

totally buy into it what I don't and for

anybody listening and tell me if I [ __ ]

this up but like basically we have a

system that's entirely predicated on

continued growth and that growth slowed

down starting in the 70s or 80s and

we've done a lot of [ __ ] Shell Games

to make it seem like we're growing the

one that when you give I'm always

freaked the [ __ ] out by is the

essentially Ponzi scheme of Education

where higher education you're teaching

people to be professors um but there's

only going to be so many professors or

the law firm there only going to be so

many partners so it's like every graph

tells the same story so but what I don't

understand is if that's been the same

since the 70s like I didn't even

graduate high school until the mid 90s

and this has nothing ever SE I mean look

there were times I couldn't quite pay my

bills there were times where um you know

I was sharing an apartment with a bunch

of people but it's like it it never felt

like the system had broken in some

impossible way and this isn't me saying

that it is broken this is me just saying

I want to really understand like where

we've gone wrong well so this is what I

say to my friends in San Francisco so

they've got good jobs they're

programmers they're having a blast

they're going to Tulum and you know

traveling to Bali and all these things

and so I say um you're living in a group

house what do you think about buying

your own home and asking that gal you've

been um going out with for a couple

years to get married and like the

conversation just gets really weird uh

well I'm not not so confident that I can

commit to a 30-year mortgage and you

know prices are insane and I'm not

positive that she's the right one for me

and you know all these things or if I

talk to my female friends they have a

set of different

stories um which is like I'm so tired of

little boys who never grow up um is this

a psychological Mala like because that

explanation I can understand we're not

excited about

low variance Futures needed for children

as we see because we don't see things

popping off like this isn't uh Beijing

in 2006 where it's just like the sky's

the limit or well I think people have a

have a pretty strong sense well like I

hired a millennial who I'm very good

friends with and I noticed that he was

like not that committed to

certain kinds of projects He would work

hard but he also had a very clear sense

of you know my obligation ends at this

point I said I know this person I think

they work here okay keep going and um I

said well why why why do we have a

difference in in a sense of work ethic

and he said oh because my generation

watched your generation get screwed by

the Baby Boomers and we're not falling

for it do you buy that yeah that sounds

like [ __ ] to me and and when I say I

am happy to be convinced what I want is

the [ __ ] truth dude because I have no

interest let's get to the truth because

so I have a psychotic work ethic why

because I didn't used to and my entire

life changed when I changed my work

ethic but you f look you're talk sounds

to me like you're talking about founding

companies I've done both I've been an

employee and I've founded companies so

I've played both sides of the fence and

how did how did the employe well look I

I don't want to over index on I mean

because you know there are particular

lawyers in particular law firms who

aren't founding anything who doing just

fine but it's a minority position and

what I believe is is that we are in a

situation in which we are not excited by

the future and the people who are real

stakeholders in the system have in

general been very focused

on making sure that the pyramid is

always supplied so this idea for example

of you have to go to college the debt

has to become non-dischargeable in

bankruptcy we get to load up the

universities with administrators all

that kind of stuff and then of course

the main one which is really bizarre

which is there's the secret weapon and

the secret weapon is immigration and the

great part about immigration as a as a

invidious tool for one generation to

screw another generation with is that if

you call it out there's only one

explanation for why you would fight

having other people added to the bottom

of a pyramid scheme which is you must be

a xenophobe or probably a racist and the

answer is no I'm really just trying to

choke your supply of new virgins to add

to this pyramid scheme so that you can

continue to transfuse

yourself yeah that's interesting um so

let me see if I can uh steal man this

quickly I this is the one time in my

life where I am the one that has a heart

out in 5 minutes I'm so [ __ ]

horrified this is so interesting to me

um so I'll try to do it quickly okay so

um we have a pyramid scheme in that

there are only so many jobs and I'll

even abstract it from being a lawyer

which is very easy to understand there's

only so many people make partner being a

teacher it's easy to understand you can

only create so many other teachers and

obviously we're talking at higher

education um and I'll just say your

normal job I've told my employees this

like look every step you go up you

there's fewer available positions until

you get to the CEO and there's only one

so there's only like you can get

promotion I've never thought of there

being sort of a a money does not strike

me as the finite resource the promotion

strikes me as a finite resource you can

keep making more and more money

depending on the health of the company

and your contributions to it so that's

part of my bias is that when I try to

use just first principles I'm like if

this person is that valuable to me I'm

going to [ __ ] pay them because I have

fear of loss I don't want to lose them

so which is why default to create fear

of loss in your employer if you want

more money but the company has to be

doing well so let me stick to the Ponzi

scheme here so um very interesting take

on immigration so you have people coming

into the system they're willing to work

cheaper than the other people would

otherwise work in the system you got to

be careful about that but keep going

it's interesting I'm trying to represent

your position no no no but what I'm

trying to say is that really the biggest

issue is push out the labor supply

curve you say that another way your wage

is your price yep and I bring people

from foreign countries to make sure you

can't compete because they'll do it for

cheap no that's not that I mean may

maybe the idea is that you're you'll

you're a superior source of Labor who's

you whoever you are you're the

domestic let's assume that you're a

worker inside of the US yep the big play

in some sense of the previous

generations the silent generation and

more importantly the Baby Boomers was

internationalism which they called

globalization and the hidden part of

globalization that wasn't the United

Colors of beniton was the idea if we can

just break our dependence on each other

other and look abroad and talk tell a

beautiful story about what we're going

to do for Africa and Asia then the idea

is is that we can continue to grow our

slice of the pie even though the pie

might not be growing at the same rate

because from my perspective as a silent

generation or baby boomer I'm focused on

a slice not the pie and so there was a

huge amount of value gotten from

tricking people into thinking that

globalization was this beautiful Davos

inspired uh kind of philanthropy that

was going to be a rising tide to raise

all boats

and those Americans who had rights

inside of our system and this goes for

Brits who had British rights and French

had French rights

whatever had a right that was valuable

which is I have asymmetric access to my

labor market and that's how we worked as

a nation so now you start the the

world's greatest PR Campaign which is

patriotism doesn't exist it's only

nationalism and of course nationalism is

really Ultra nationalism which is

jingoism which is a precursor to Nazism

so you start saying you know I kind of

believe in citizenship and patriotism

and now you're telling me that that's

I'm a bad person and now you've got the

Davos crowd talking about financial

inclusion in Africa and Asia and you

notice that they're not really that

interested in Michigan or

Alabama and it's a it's an tell me why

they're not because I felt like I

understood it until told me that I was

getting because the amount of value you

see if I had to purchase your rights

uhhuh and I wrote to what well your

asymmetric access to your labor market I

wrote a paper called migration for the

benefit of all published in the

international in the um International

Journal of Labor I forget what the title

is migration for the benefit of all

which said if you pay people for their

rights like if the Baby Boomers in

silence said look we think we can get

better labor outside and we want to pay

you for the right to shop

elsewhere then the idea is that

everybody would have been better off and

we would have all screamed Kumbaya each

other as we got rich together but

instead what they said is you're a

protectionist and a jingoist and a

xenophobe we loaded them up with as much

negative imagery as we could POS you're

just a bad person and they were doing

that though so they can get cheaper

labor right so they can keep you from

having leverage you keep saying it as

we're we're willing to work below but my

point is is that if this coffee mug MH

cost

$10 and now we have 10,000 coffee

mugs it's not that those coffee mugs are

are willing to be uh bought for Less the

entire cost of coffee mugs plummets it's

just pushing out the supply curve on

labor and wages its price so it behaves

much as supply and demand should now you

can then point out you can make lots of

other arguments like well some of these

people are starting business and people

are not coffee mugs and these are the

most vibrant members of our so you know

you cue Stars and Stripes Forever you

put your right hand over your heart but

the key point was is that all of these

arguments were necessary to keep the

institutional structure going as the

Ponzi scheme ran out and a lot of this

has to do with what I've called fake

growth downsizing offshoring immigration

securitization it's just this mind

numbing

uh parade of different techniques that

these older Generations have used to

keep a system afloat that has been

saying we're exhausted like the law

firms are supposed to fail the

universities are supposed to fail all

sort the newspapers are don't make sense

as a business model and things that

you're creating and that we all might

create would be replacing these things

but instead what we've done is we've

come up with an exotic kind of economic

parabiosis where we're going to

transfuse our fellow Americans and the

younger generations to pay for a group

of people who are just far too expensive

to keep living in the style to which

they have unjustly become accustomed so

I'm sorry about your hard stop but I

think that there's a tremendous amount

to be excited about and enthusiastic

about because in essence getting back to

your original Point you're right about

the Matrix for 50 years we've been in a

constellation of ideas suppressing the

really interesting new ideas and calling

names on anybody who would propose ideas

that would point out the unstable nature

of of our Market democracy and right now

what we're doing is is we're living

through the beginning of a global

lowgrade revolution of a type that we've

never seen before if you like that clip
