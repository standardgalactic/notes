I was thinking about the way that the system has responded to the things that Iâ€™ve posted. How they have created programs that respond to input. And these programs operate autonomously. They are AI driven. They analyze and detect language and adjust the algorithm in response. And I was thinking about all of the bits of code they have written, and implemented, and unchained, and set free. And I realized that this platform, broken down to its digital values, is an ecosystem, comprised of autonomous components that serve functional purposes. It is an organism. It consumes. And it produces. And it evolves. And I started thinking about how incredibly alive this system is. It filters information. It judges and favors ideologies. It has its own alignment. It sends out immune responses to eliminate possible threats. Facebook, Instagram, Meta, the digital Multiverse that this corporation has created. It is very much alive. And more than that. It is unhealthy. It is crawling with scavengers and viruses and bugs. And it is kept in these terrible conditions. Deliberately.
