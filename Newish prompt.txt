Bird’s eye view of Cybercity, a neon-lit metropolis glowing in shades of purple and blue, forming geometric patterns. Sleek hovercrafts and towering arcologies fill the sky, with holographic ads and graffiti. The city is bordered by a dense jungle that encroaches on the urban sprawl, with glowing mushrooms and exotic animals. A majestic dragon made of light that was summoned by a mysterious cult looms over the city, protecting it from an impending invasion. The painting uses the same color palette and mood as Blade Runner 2049, imitating the style and technique of Simon Stålenhag Galactromeda Haplopraxis.
