*The popularization of science*

It's funny how the division between the science of which the general public knows something about and the one they know nothing about is not that it is inconsistent, but it is, in the near opposite of the division between science that can essentially be talked about and science that cannot be talked about.

The same strings: yes, the whole popularization of strings is "and in poems it sounds very, very prudent", but who is that stopping? The shops are packed with popular books about strings, and the shirnarmasses all, in general, heard the bell.

As Gaine would say, you will no longer be allowed in any public house if you can't drum about extra dimensions and compactification upon entering. It seems easier to talk about the physics of a condensed state, but they don't. Pretty much.

The function of popularizing science nowadays is exclusively religious. The need for mysteries and mythology must be met (including, the obligatory cosmogonic mythology; the dragon devours the Sun, Marduk tears out the jaw of Tiamat, universes born from quantum fluctuations foam, that's all). Clarity has nothing to do with it, on the contrary: it shouldn't be.

Otherwise, the consumer of knowledge will not feel that he has been involved in great secrets and will demand money back.
