It hurt my feelings to see my followers drop, even though I know I break lots of rules and am either controversial or incoherent. A few minutes later I think maybe they were just deleted accounts, or maybe you can turn off your follow settings. 

It seems that I am using the technique my logic teacher used in university, to be very bizarre and idiosyncratic to weed out the "audience" that finds it problematic. Wouldn't it just be better not to see how many people are following you? I see people on Facebook complaining that their posts are being shadowbanned when they get 4 or 5 posts when they sometimes get a hundred. Others comment that people might be not interested, no one mentions people might be interested and reading but not clicking like.

On Twitter I saw a person asking how to game the system, they complained no one gets any traction until they have 10,000 followers. I saw they had 62.5 thousand tweets. Maybe they think it is the quantity or frequency of tweets that count. But there must be millions of people posting who get little to no engagement.

These metrics all seem so arbitrary and unrelated to anything meaningful. Why would the popularity of anything or anyone be considered useful when it is clearly and obviously incorrect so often. Pay to play is bad enough, but soon, it might be pay to think.
