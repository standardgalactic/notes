The myth of the objective is an idea that suggests that all decisions or judgments can be made without bias. This misconception is based on the assumption that human beings have perfect knowledge and the ability to make impartial judgments, which is not the case.

In reality, humans are prone to bias, and the idea of making unbiased decisions is a false one. The myth of the objective can lead to dangerous outcomes if used to justify major decisions or choices, as it discounts the role of subjectivity and fails to account for potential bias.
