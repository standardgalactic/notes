FHI, the creation of my biggest personal opponent creationist AI doomer pseudophilosopher Nick Bostrom is shutting down unexpectedly.

Was this the "simulation shutdown risk" they were seemingly worried about? Perhaps one of their benefactors/enablers reached out and informed there was no longer any need for this stupid psyops because they are confident that they can corner the AI market.

In any case, it is a shameless rug pull and proof that their concerns have never been genuine in the least. FHI was a fraud through and through and Bostrom is an incredulous charlatan of the highest degree. It is voiced by some that the reason was that it came out that Bostrom is a nazi through his old racist e-mails. He is a nazi scumbag that everyone must despise, keep in mind, please.
