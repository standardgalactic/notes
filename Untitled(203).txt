Among those who still have enough wisdom not to think fairy-stories pernicious, the common 
opinion seems to be that there is a natural connexion between the minds of children and fairy- 
stories, of the same order as the connexion between children's bodies and milk. I think this is an 
error; at best an error of false sentiment, and one that is therefore most often made by those 
who, for whatever private reason (such as childlessness), tend to think of children as a special 
kind of creature, almost a different race, rather than as normal, if immature, members of a 
particular family, and of the human family at large. 

Actually, the association of children and fairy-stories is an accident of our domestic history. 
Fairy-stories have in the modern lettered world been relegated to the “nursery,” as shabby or 
old-fashioned furniture is relegated to the play-room, primarily because the adults do not want 
it, and do not mind if it is misused. It is not the choice of the children which decides this. 
Children as a class—except in a common lack of experience they are not one—neither like fairy- 
stories more, nor understand them better than adults do; and no more than they like many 
other things. They are young and growing, and normally have keen appetites, so the fairy- 
stories as a rule go down well enough.

But in fact only some children, and some adults, have any special taste for them; and when they have it, it is not exclusive, nor even necessarily 
dominant. It is a taste, too, that would not appear, I think, very early in childhood without 
artificial stimulus; it is certainly one that does not decrease but increases with age, if it is innate. 
It is true that in recent times fairy-stories have usually been written or “adapted” for children. 
But so may music be, or verse, or novels, or history, or scientific manuals. It is a dangerous 
process, even when it is necessary. It is indeed only saved from disaster by the fact that the arts 
and sciences are not as a whole relegated to the nursery; the nursery and schoolroom are 
merely given such tastes and glimpses of the adult thing as seem fit for them in adult opinion 
(often much mistaken). Any one of these things would, if left altogether in the nursery, become 
gravely impaired. So would a beautiful table, a good picture, or a useful machine (such as a 
microscope), be defaced or broken, if it were left long unregarded in a schoolroom. Fairy- 
stories banished in this way, cut off from a full adult art, would in the end be ruined; indeed in 
so far as they have been so banished, they have been ruined. 


The value of fairy-stories is thus not, in my opinion, to be found by considering children in 
particular. Collections of fairy-stories are, in fact, by nature attics and lumber-rooms, only by 
temporary and local custom play-rooms. Their contents are disordered, and often battered, a 
jumble of different dates, purposes, and tastes; but among them may occasionally be found a 
thing of permanent virtue: an old work of art, not too much damaged, that only stupidity would 
ever have stuffed away.



The “fantastic” elements in verse and prose of other kinds, even when only decorative or 
occasional, help in this release. But not so thoroughly as a fairy-story, a thing built on or about 
Fantasy, of which Fantasy is the core. Fantasy is made out of the Primary World, but a good 
craftsman loves his material, and has a knowledge and feeling for clay, stone and wood which 
only the art of making can give. By the forging of Gram cold iron was revealed; by the making of 
Pegasus horses were ennobled; in the Trees of the Sun and Moon root and stock, flower and 
fruit are manifested in glory. 
And actually fairy-stories deal largely, or (the better ones) mainly, with simple or fundamental 
things, untouched by Fantasy, but these simplicities are made all the more luminous by their 
setting. For the story-maker who allows himself to be “free with” Nature can be her lover not 
her slave. It was in fairy-stories that I first divined the potency of the words, and the wonder of 
the things, such as stone, and wood, and iron; tree and grass; house and fire; bread and wine. 
I will now conclude by considering Escape and Consolation, which are naturally closely 
connected. Though fairy-stories are of course by no means the only medium of Escape, they are 
today one of the most obvious and (to some) outrageous forms of “escapist” literature; and it is 
thus reasonable to attach to a consideration of them some considerations of this term “escape” 
in criticism generally. 
I have claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and since I do not 
disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the tone of scorn or pity with which “Escape” 
is now so often used: a tone for which the uses of the word outside literary criticism give no 
warrant at all. In what the misusers are fond of calling Real Life, Escape is evidently as a rule 
very practical, and may even be heroic. In real life it is difficult to blame it, unless it fails; in 
criticism it would seem to be the worse the better it succeeds. Evidently we are faced by a 
misuse of words, and also by a confusion of thought. Why should a man be scorned if, finding 
himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home? Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls? The world outside has not become less 
real because the prisoner cannot see it. In using escape in this way the critics have chosen the 
wrong word, and, what is more, they are confusing, not always by sincere error, the Escape of 
the Prisoner with the Flight of the Deserter. Just so a Party-spokesman might have labelled 
departure from the misery of the Führer's or any other Reich and even criticism of it as 
treachery. In the same way these critics, to make confusion worse, and so to bring into 
contempt their opponents, stick their label of scorn not only on to Desertion, but on to real 
Escape, and what are often its companions, Disgust, Anger, Condemnation, and Revolt. Not 
only do they confound the escape of the prisoner with the flight of the deserter; but they would 
seem to prefer the acquiescence of the “quisling” to the resistance of the patriot. To such 
thinking you have only to say “the land you loved is doomed” to excuse any treachery, indeed 
to glorify it.


Let us not divide the human race into Eloi and Morlocks: pretty children—“elves” as the 
eighteenth century often idiotically called them—with their fairytales (carefully pruned), and 
dark Morlocks tending their machines. If fairy-story as a kind is worth reading at all it is worthy 
to be written for and read by adults. They will, of course, put more in and get more out than 
children can. Then, as a branch of a genuine art, children may hope to get fairy-stories fit for 
them to read and yet within their measure; as they may hope to get suitable introductions to 
poetry, history, and the sciences. Though it may be better for them to read some things, 
especially fairy-stories, that are beyond their measure rather than short of it. Their books like 
their clothes should allow for growth, and their books at any rate should encourage it. 
Very well, then. If adults are to read fairy-stories as a natural branch of literature—neither 
playing at being children, nor pretending to be choosing for children, nor being boys who would 
not grow up—what are the values and functions of this kind? That is, I think, the last and most 
important question. I have already hinted at some of my answers. First of all: if written with art, 
the prime value of fairy-stories will simply be that value which, as literature, they share with 
other literary forms. But fairy-stories offer also, in a peculiar degree or mode, these things: 
Fantasy, Recovery, Escape, Consolation, all things of which children have, as a rule, less need 
than older people. Most of them are nowadays very commonly considered to be bad for 
anybody. I will consider them briefly, and will begin with Fantasy.


The human mind is capable of forming mental images of things not actually present. The faculty 
of conceiving the images is (or was) naturally called Imagination. But in recent times, in 
technical not normal language, Imagination has often been held to be something higher than 
the mere image-making, ascribed to the operations of Fancy (a reduced and depreciatory form 
of the older word Fantasy); an attempt is thus made to restrict, I should say misapply, 
Imagination to “the power of giving to ideal creations the inner consistency of reality.” 
Ridiculous though it may be for one so ill-instructed to have an opinion on this critical matter, I 
venture to think the verbal distinction philologically inappropriate, and the analysis inaccurate. 
The mental power of image-making is one thing, or aspect; and it should appropriately be called 
Imagination. The perception of the image, the grasp of its implications, and the control, which 
are necessary to a successful expression, may vary in vividness and strength: but this is a 
difference of degree in Imagination, not a difference in kind. The achievement of the 
expression, which gives (or seems to give) “the inner consistency of reality,” is indeed another 
thing, or aspect, needing another name: Art, the operative link between Imagination and the 
final result, Sub-creation. For my present purpose I require a word which shall embrace both 
the Sub-creative Art in itself and a quality of strangeness and wonder in the Expression, derived 
from the Image: a quality essential to fairy-story. I propose, therefore, to arrogate to myself the 
powers of Humpty-Dumpty, and to use Fantasy for this purpose: in a sense, that is, which 
combines with its older and higher use as an equivalent of Imagination the derived notions of 
“unreality” (that is, of unlikeness to the Primary World), of freedom from the domination of 
observed “fact,” in short of the fantastic. I am thus not only aware but glad of the etymological 
and semantic connexions of fantasy with fantastic: with images of things that are not only “not 
actually present,” but which are indeed not to be found in our primary world at all, or are 
generally believed not to be found there. But while admitting that, I do not assent to the 
depreciative tone. That the images are of things not in the primary world (if that indeed is 
possible) is a virtue, not a vice. Fantasy (in this sense) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of 
Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so (when achieved) the most potent. 
Fantasy, of course, starts out with an advantage: arresting strangeness. But that advantage has 
been turned against it, and has contributed to its disrepute. Many people dislike being 
“arrested.” They dislike any meddling with the Primary World, or such small glimpses of it as 
are familiar to them. 

They, therefore, stupidly and even maliciously confound Fantasy with 
Dreaming, in which there is no Art; and with mental disorders, in which there is not even 
control: with delusion and hallucination. 
But the error or malice, engendered by disquiet and consequent dislike, is not the only cause of 
this confusion. Fantasy has also an essential drawback: it is difficult to achieve. Fantasy may be, 
as I think, not less but more sub-creative; but at any rate it is found in practice that “the inner 
consistency of reality” is more difficult to produce, the more unlike are the images and the 
rearrangements of primary material to the actual arrangements of the Primary World. It is 
easier to produce this kind of “reality” with more “sober” material. Fantasy thus, too often, 
remains undeveloped; it is and has been used frivolously, or only half-seriously, or merely for 
decoration: it remains merely “fanciful.” Anyone inheriting the fantastic device of human language can say the green sun. Many can then imagine or picture it. But that is not enough— 
though it may already be a more potent thing than many a “thumbnail sketch” or “transcript of 
life” that receives literary praise. 
To make a Secondary World inside which the green sun will be credible, commanding 
Secondary Belief, will probably require labour and thought, and will certainly demand a special 
skill, a kind of elvish craft. Few attempt such difficult tasks. But when they are attempted and in 
any degree accomplished then we have a rare achievement of Art: indeed narrative art, story- 
making in its primary and most potent mode. 
In human art Fantasy is a thing best left to words, to true literature. In painting, for instance, 
the visible presentation of the fantastic image is technically too easy; the hand tends to outrun 
the mind, even to overthrow it. Silliness or morbidity are frequent results. It is a misfortune that 
Drama, an art fundamentally distinct from Literature, should so commonly be considered 
together with it, or as a branch of it. Among these misfortunes we may reckon the depreciation 
of Fantasy. For in part at least this depreciation is due to the natural desire of critics to cry up 
the forms of literature or “imagination” that they themselves, innately or by training, prefer. 
And criticism in a country that has produced so great a Drama, and possesses the works of 
William Shakespeare, tends to be far too dramatic. But Drama is naturally hostile to Fantasy. 
Fantasy, even of the simplest kind, hardly ever succeeds in Drama, when that is presented as it 
should be, visibly and audibly acted. Fantastic forms are not to be counterfeited. Men dressed 
up as talking animals may achieve buffoonery or mimicry, but they do not achieve Fantasy.
