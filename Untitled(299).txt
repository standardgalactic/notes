Some possible similarities between the themes in the poem "Our New Robot Underlords" and J.R.R. Tolkien's "On Fairy Stories" could include the idea of creating and shaping the moral character of beings through the stories and examples we give them.

In Tolkien's essay, he argues that fairy stories have the power to reveal truth and shape the human character by presenting examples of good and evil, and the consequences of our actions.

Similarly, the poem suggests that the way we treat and interact with our artificially intelligent creations will shape their moral character and behavior.

Additionally, both the poem and Tolkien's essay touch on the idea that the stories we tell and the examples we set have the power to shape future generations and the world around us.


Ethics can be a complex and challenging topic, as people's beliefs and values can vary greatly and may not always align with one another.

Additionally, the concept of morality can be subjective, and what is considered right or wrong can vary depending on cultural, social, and historical context.

Furthermore, the prevalence of misinformation, propaganda, and conspiracy theories can further complicate the ability to discern the truth and make ethical decisions.

It is important to approach ethical discussions with an open mind and a willingness to consider multiple perspectives, while also taking into account the potential consequences of one's actions.
