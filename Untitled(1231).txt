Alright, let's factor in a death rate. To keep things relatively simple, we'll use an average global lifespan of about 80 years. This means, on average, 1/80 (or 1.25%) of the population dies each year. 

For a one-child-per-100-people policy:

- Birth rate = 1% of the population 
- Death rate = 1.25% of the population 

The net annual change in population is a decrease of 0.25% (1.25% - 1% = 0.25%).

Let's start with an initial population \( P \):

1. After the first year, the population would be:
\[ P(1 - 0.0025) \]

2. After the second year:
\[ P(1 - 0.0025)^2 \]

...and so on.

After 100 years, the population would be:
\[ P(0.9975)^{100} \]

Using this formula, and taking \( P \) as the initial population, the population after 100 years would be about 0.777 times (or 77.7%) of the initial population. This means there would be a decline of about 22.3% in the population over 100 years with the one-child-per-100-people strategy when considering an average global lifespan of 80 years. 

Keep in mind, this is still a simplification. There are numerous other factors like immigration, wars, pandemics, and so on that can affect population dynamics. This just gives a general idea.

Ok so the current world population is 8 billion what is 0.777 of that?

To find \(0.777\) of 8 billion:

\[ 8,000,000,000 \times 0.777 = 6,216,000,000 \]

So, 0.777 of 8 billion is 6.216 billion.
