Had a nice trip to Toronto. Drove up in the truck with my mother and father, it is like a fifteen hour drive, believe it or not. Stayed for a week and drove back.

They ended up buying a fixer,upper for like 1.2 million it's their first house they are expecting.

It was built in 1911, I tore out three kitchens (four if you count a used set that he bought) rebuilt a washroom, installed a bigger window in the down stairs basement, took some trips to the dump transfer station. 

Added some plugs and breakers and replaced old shutoffs.  Did get to hang out and have some meals together.

Sometimes it seems like my parents and I are arguing or bickering over every little detail, I'm not sure if this is some kind of feedback loop, but it some nice being back in a quieter city with no traffic.

It's clear that the same house would be one million dollars cheaper. I still think I have an opportunity to build a house from scratch for my aunt including the land it will be a small house but will cost under 275,000$

I have one live painting gig at future forest this fall, which is like a long weekend or something, maybe it is ridiculous of course it will be fun camping if the weather is good, but it really sucks if it rains, like everything gets muddy... You end up spending time building tarps or moving things out of the way. I am told I can build whatever I want or need in terms of roofs stages storage units.

I know we talked about it before, but given how extremely disorganized and uncoordinated it is, the less likely I am to invest in the idea.

Like maybe it is a ridiculous amount of work for no reason, and I should just get a desk or an office job...
