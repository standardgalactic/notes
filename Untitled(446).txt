The main thesis of this paper is that the surface tension of cosmic voids plays a significant role in the global expansion of the universe due to the existence of inhomogeneities, and this issue is closely related to the backreaction problem. Backreaction refers to the effect of inhomogeneities caused by matter and geometry on the global expansion of the universe. The Newtonian limit of general relativity assumes a Euclidean geometry, and it neglects the role of curved geometry on a global scale. However, when we consider the global scale of the universe, the role of both matter and geometric inhomogeneities must be taken into account to obtain the desired results. The consequence of considering these factors is a non-zero backreaction that can affect the dynamics and accelerating expansion of the universe.

The model presented in this paper considers the second-order terms in the cosmic equation of state, and it takes into account the interacting or merging supervoids on the cosmic scale. The merging supervoids that are enclosed by superclusters are the best possible candidates for the physical objects that are interacting with each other on the cosmic scale. By considering the effect of merging vast voids on the cosmic web and the enlargement of empty spaces over time, the idea of using bubbles' surface tension as a possible model for studying the effects of supervoids pressure in accelerating expansion is proposed.

In conclusion, the role of supervoids and their surface tension is taken seriously in this article because they are the main factor in the production of supervoids/superclusters due to inhomogeneities in the structure of the universe. The model presented in this paper can achieve an important request by heuristically calculating the surface
