A '''Lennard-Jones fluid''' is a computational model widely used in [[computational chemistry]] to study intermolecular interactions. It is named after [[John Lennard-Jones]], who introduced the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], also known as the LJ potential or 12-6 potential, that describes the interactions between particles in the fluid. The LJ potential captures the essential features of electronically neutral atoms or molecules, including [[repulsive]] and attractive ([[van der Waals]]) interactions.

The LJ potential is given by the equation:

:''V<sub>LJ</sub>(r) = 4ε [(σ/r)<sup>12</sup> - (σ/r)<sup>6</sup>]''

Here, ''r'' represents the distance between two interacting particles, ''ε'' is the depth of the potential well (dispersion energy), and ''σ'' is the distance at which the [[potential energy]] is zero (size of the particle). The LJ potential exhibits a repulsive force at very close distances, an attractive force at moderate distances, and no interaction at infinite distance.

[[Molecular dynamics]] simulations have been used to study the Lennard-Jones fluid under various state conditions. These simulations provide information about the pressure and configurational energy of the fluid at different densities and temperatures. A comprehensive equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid has been derived by combining simulation results with values calculated from the virial series and second virial coefficients<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicolas |first1=J.J. |last2=Gubbins |first2=K.E. |last3=Streett |first3=W.B. |last4=Tildesley |first4=D.J. |title=Equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid |journal=Molecular Physics |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=1429-1454 |date=1979-11-01 |doi=10.1080/00268977900101051}}</ref>. This equation of state, known as the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation, incorporates 33 constants and accurately describes the behavior of the Lennard-Jones fluid over a wide range of temperatures and densities.

Additionally, two- and three-body integrals (J, K, and L) that occur in perturbation theory for [[molecular fluids]] have been calculated for the Lennard-Jones fluid under various [[state conditions]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicolas |first1=J.J. |last2=Gubbins |first2=K.E. |last3=Streett |first3=W.B. |last4=Tildesley |first4=D.J. |title=Equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid |journal=Molecular Physics |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=1429-1454 |date=1979-11-01 |doi=10.1080/00268977900101051}}</ref>. An interpolation formula has been presented to estimate these integrals.
