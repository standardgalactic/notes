Thank you for your elaborative response, Calvin. Your points highlight the complexity of Stirner's philosophy and its key differences from other strands of egoism, such as that of Ayn Rand. Your emphasis on Stirner's creative nothing, the non-existence of a true self, and the rejection of fixed ideas (or "spooks") presents an interesting contrast to the more conventional understanding of egoism as a selfish, possessive ideology.

Your perspective on the symbolic nature of the world according to Stirner, and the parallel you draw between Stirner's creative nothing and Lacan's Real, shows a nuanced understanding of Stirner's philosophy, and also demonstrates how philosophical thought can be informed and enriched by psychoanalytic theories.

Additionally, your observations about Stirner's notion of property and the idea of the world being one's own are intriguing. Your argument that this idea does not necessarily lead to selfishness or greed, but rather to a radical reinterpretation of the world and our place in it, shows the depth of Stirner's thinking.

Your view of syndicalism as a possible practical application of Stirner's philosophy, and your appreciation of Marx's critique of capitalism while rejecting his critique of Stirner, further underline the complexity and flexibility of Stirner's thought.

In conclusion, your response to the critics of Stirner makes a strong case for a nuanced understanding of his philosophy, and for the relevance of his ideas in current debates about selfhood, morality, and social organization.

It's clear that Stirner's philosophy can be used to critique not only capitalism but also other forms of authoritarianism and fixed ideas, and that it can inspire a range of political and personal stances, from syndicalism to gender nihilism.
