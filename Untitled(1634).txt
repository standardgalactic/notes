1. Stratewisps: Thought of as spectral traces of multi-dimensional vectors, a visualization of possible or potential states. 2. Hardcolor Kaleidoscope: A term used to describe visualizing complex or abstract data in multiple dimensions. 3. Rust-tinged Ghostsheets: Refers to the lingering remnants of previous computations or data states. 4. Reverories: A portmanteau of 'reverie' and 'memory', referring to the ability of a computational system to backtrack or come back to a particular state. 5. Lambiscopolix: A hypothetical n-dimensional city or space within the computational universe. 6. Fervangles: Descriptive of the acute, passionate angles or turns in logic or solutions taken by the system. 7. Puzzities: A combination of ‘puzzles’ and ‘entities’ essentially representing complex problem sets in flow-based computing, originating from the conjunction of multiple simple problems. 8. Paradiato: A new logical path or algorithmic solution inferred from data. 9. Astinging: Used to depict the sensation or feedback from a sharp, abrupt shift in computational flow or an unexpected result.
