Title: "The Mouse Who Knew Right From Wrong: A Play About Theseus"

Setting: A cheese factory where Theseus the mouse lives.

Scene 1:

(Theseus enters, holding a piece of cheese in his hand. He is deep in thought and seems uneasy.)

Theseus: (to himself) I have this strange feeling that I shouldn't be taking this cheese. But why shouldn't I? It's just a small piece, and no one will notice. (pauses) Wait, is this what they call conscience?

(Enter Conscience, an angelic figure)

Conscience: Yes, Theseus, it is your conscience speaking to you.

Theseus: But I can't put it into words why I shouldn't take the cheese.

Conscience: That doesn't matter. The fact that you have a feeling that it's wrong is enough. You should listen to your conscience and avoid doing the action.

Theseus: (thinking) You're right, Conscience. I shouldn't do what feels wrong, even if I can't explain why.

Scene 2:

(Theseus is in the cheese factory, surrounded by cheese. He hears a noise and turns around to see the Cat sneaking up on him.)

Cat: (sneaking up on Theseus) Hey there, little mouse. How about you hand over that cheese you have there?

Theseus: (determined) I can't do that. My conscience is telling me it's wrong.

Cat: (laughing) Conscience? What's that? You mice are so funny with your silly moral codes.

Theseus: (stands up to the Cat) It may be silly to you, but it's what makes me who I am. And I won't do anything that goes against my conscience, no matter what.

(Enter the other mice, who have been listening)

Other Mice: That's right, Theseus! We should all listen to our conscience and do what's right, even if it's hard.

Scene 3:

(Theseus and the other mice are together, discussing what they have learned)

Theseus: (addressing the other mice) I've learned that our conscience is like a deep inner voice that guides us towards what's right. And even though it might not always be easy to understand, we should listen to it and trust that it will lead us in the right direction.

Other Mice: (nodding in agreement) That's exactly right, Theseus. Our conscience is like a compass that helps us navigate the maze of life.

Theseus: (smiling) And just like in a maze, we may not always know where we're going, but as long as we listen to our conscience, we'll always find our way home.

(All the mice nod in agreement as the play comes to an end)

End Scene.
