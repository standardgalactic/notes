Existential or non existential?

Not afraid of AGO but I think if I widely publish my thoughts it could put me at risk - I am sure I can offend Christians, Muslims, and Atheists alike, even without intending to.

It seems to me that the general public and many people I know are suspicious of intelligence in general, but I don't know.

As soon as people see how complicated something is, they get intimidated and scared.

I think the overwhelming majority of people have good intentions but I have met a few very toxic people. 
If I offend the wrong toxic person they could try to harm me.

Is the solution to not make any art or not to share my ideas or essays? 

Somehow I don't think so, I just figured out how to be more subtle, but really it is difficult to get a second opinion on any of this.
