It does seem odd that the "what is it like to be a bat" argument is attributed to Nagel.

Almost the same argument was made here, and Nagel admits this in footnote 2 of chapter 2 of "the view from nowhere." 1986

"Since it's never too late for an acknowledgement, let me record that two years earlier Timothy Sprigge had proposed as the essential condition of consciousness that there must be 'something it is like to be' the creature in question (Sprigge, pp. 166-8). And B. A. Farrell asked, 'What would it be like to be a bat?' in 1950, though he dismissed the difficulty for materialism. (When I wrote, I hadn't read Sprigge and had forgotten Farrell.)"
