The Creativity Code: How AI Is Learning to Write, Paint and Think

by 

Marcus du Sautoy

 3.98  ·   Rating details ·  1,138 ratings  ·  137 reviews

The award-winning author of The Music of the Primes explores the future of creativity and how machine learning will disrupt, enrich, and transform our understanding of what it means to be human.

Can a well-programmed machine do anything a human can―only better? Complex algorithms are choosing our music, picking our partners, and driving our investments. They can navigate more data than a doctor or lawyer and act with greater precision. For many years we’ve taken solace in the notion that they can’t create. But now that algorithms can learn and adapt, does the future of creativity belong to machines, too?

It is hard to imagine a better guide to the bewildering world of artificial intelligence than Marcus du Sautoy, a celebrated Oxford mathematician whose work on symmetry in the ninth dimension has taken him to the vertiginous edge of mathematical understanding. In The Creativity Code he considers what machine learning means for the future of creativity. The Pollockizer can produce drip paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock, Botnik spins off fanciful (if improbable) scenes inspired by J. K. Rowling, and the music-composing algorithm Emmy managed to fool a panel of Bach experts. But do these programs just mimic, or do they have what it takes to create? Du Sautoy argues that to answer this question, we need to understand how the algorithms that drive them work―and this brings him back to his own subject of mathematics, with its puzzles, constraints, and enticing possibilities.

While most recent books on AI focus on the future of work, The Creativity Code moves us to the forefront of creative new technologies and offers a more positive and unexpected vision of our future cohabitation with machines. It challenges us to reconsider what it means to be human―and to crack the creativity code. (less)

Nov 01, 2020Taylor Ellwood rated it it was amazing

Shelves: academia, science, creativity

The creativity code explores algorithms and how technology is being used to impact creativity, art, and innovation with AI. The author explores AI algorithms in music, writing, art, science and mathematics and shows how algorithms are impacting these disciplines as well as the human response to AIs. It’s a fascinating read that explores how the evolution of technology is impacting our lives, but what I find most intriguing is the possibility of how human creativity can evolve as a result.

Interesting look at AI deep learning with some examples I wasn’t familiar with, like the Rembrandt fake and AI music generating algorithms for games and commercial purposes. The section on math proofs was not my thing. Overall, leaves you to contemplate human creativity and how our minds work. Is AI just another tool? Are humans really just pattern recognizing and manipulating machines? Can we use AI to accomplish our creative ends?

I thoroughly enjoyed this book

The question raised in this book is can Artificial Intelligence become truly creative. The author covers all the strides that SO has made but tackles that key question of what is actual creativity. A well written and engaging book and a real pleasure to read.

Super interesting book

This book reignited my love for math and computer science. My two takeaways: 1. yes other subjects are also creative and you need creativity to be exceptional in math and STEMy areas. 2. The computational divide (i.e. for and against using computers as opposed to old school methods) exists even within maths!

“Being able to share our conscious world through stories is what makes us humans.” Thought-provoking epilogue to a hugely satisfying book. Recommended to anyone intrigued by AI and interested in a balanced, immersive essay on what it is to be creative. Not recommended to those looking for a clear-cut “AI vs Humans” final answer.

Shelves: philosophy, popular-science, mathematics

This book is obviously popular science, but a very good one at that. Easy to follow, with engaging anecdotes and interesting thoughts and thought-experiments that keep the reader on track. Some very interesting questions being asked here, and I especially enjoyed the chapters on art and music. Highly recommended!

3.5 stars for me. The first half kept me very engaged and fascinated but then something loses me in the way it goes into further depth and maybe the way the topics are arranged. Still was a worthy read I learned a lot o didn’t know about AI in the arts and feel alternately wowed, nervous and fascinated.

Shelves: non-space-science, audible, audiobook

A book that more people interested in how code affects their lives should read. It’s let down somewhat by some pretty abstract mathematical talk, but as to be expected as it was written by a mathematician. The overwhelming majority of the book is a fascinating and deep trip through how code and algorithms have and will change.

Don't remember the exact content, for it was a year ago that I read it, but I found it very interesting at the start, but it couldn't retain my attention in the end.
Especially the part about DeepBlue/AlphaGo conquering Lee Sedol - the world's best Go-player was amusing, and kind of terrifying at the same time. One should watch the documentary on youtube! (AlphaGo-the movie). (less)

Jul 25, 2022Dave Snowdon rated it really liked it  ·  review of another edition

A tour through how AI and machine learning has been used and is being used in a way that could be said to be creative. The overarching concern of the author is whether AI/ML could be on the verge of making human creativity obsolete and in particular will AI make him, as a mathematician obsolete. The book is aimed at the layperson is is non-technical and easy to read.

Oct 01, 2022Joe Born rated it really liked it

It's not a bad book, takes a slightly different view of AI and creativity and has some useful definitions of creativity. In the end, the conclusion is appropriately gray, but he does a decent job of exploring that and along the way did a nice job of providing food for thought with some interesting examples. (less)

Dec 21, 2022Mert Topcu rated it it was ok

Definitely expected more from this book.

Got only a collection of AI history, creativity projects with AI (some of them were unknown to me hence I enjoyed learning about them).

However there was no deep analysis of philosophical ideas or hypothesis except saying AI is far from achieving transformational creativity.

Meanwhile AI is getting into that territory in an exponentially fast way.

Awe-inspiring read. My only critique is the fact that the author does a bit too much of self-referencing from time to time. Other than that, great read on the state-of-the-art of AI applications in the creative fields of music, writing, gaming and mathematics.

I learned some details behind the news about AI from this book. Also I enjoyed this audiobook because it make me feel like positive to AI. The wealth (especially emotional content) produced by AI will make us happy in the future, I believe.

Excellent succinct and personable synopsis of the state of AI as it bests the top GO players and composes pretty reasonable music. The mathematics love gets a little dry but it’s su Sautoy’s passion and he doesn’t overwhelm with the mechanics of it.

Some interesting anecdotes- e.g. about Russian mathematician Voevodsky who required access to "hard drugs" to accept a position @Oxford :) Overall, some interesting thoughts about mathematics.
In other areas it's mostly the same AlphaGo, etc. AI hype. (less)

A very good book to bring you upto speed with advances of machine learning specifically AI. Trying to find answers and sometimes predictions to question such as do Androids dream of electric sheeps.

Had a good ride.

Certainly, it is one of the most exciting books that I have read. It provokes new ideas, introduces some of the seminal advances in the field of AI. However the last few chapter could have been better.

Some chapters were more verbose than I would have liked it, sometimes the author flaunted with his mathematical knowledge, where it had little to do with the subject, but overall it was a good book with great insights and wordly-wise conclusions.

Shelves: nonfiction, ai

Highly interesting book on how AI is learning to become creative. Full of engaging stories that stick with you throughout, but can be a tad dry in certain sections. Worth reading, but be prepared for seeing through a mathematician's lens and discecting algebras to explain the pattern in the code. (less)

I started this by accident, way out of my wheel house, but really liked it and there’s an aspect of it that’s scary without trying to be scary in the sense that it begs the question what will we have to do to inevitably get away from the AI…

The Creativity Code tracks the development of AI through a range of unexpected fields. Although its exploration of each field is surface-level, it raises insightful questions about whether we will one day compete with computers for our jobs.

I give this book 3.5 stars as much of the information is a decade old (like computers playing chess, Go, and Jeopardy). For someone wanting an overview of AI used in different applications, this would be a good foundational book.

Superficial. I got it mainly to read the AlphaGo / Demis Hassabis parts but there was nothing new. It was all very rote. When I got to the section entitled "What is Art?" I rolled my eyes. (less)
