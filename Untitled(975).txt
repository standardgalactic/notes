The task of Art is to lift man from the realm of mere things to the realm of values, to create out of the materials of the world around us something which is not world but a value, to make something new and beautiful, not for its own sake, but as a revelation of the beauty and value of the world which we might not otherwise see."

— J.R.R. Tolkien

J.R.R. Tolkien said that quote in his essay "On Fairy-Stories", which was first delivered as a lecture at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland in 1939 and later published in a book of the same name in 1947.

It was collection of essays discussing the nature of fantasy and fairy-tales, and the role of such stories in human culture. It also includes his famous definition of the "fantasy" as a "sub-creation" which he calls "a secondary world".

I apologize, I misspoke in my previous response. The quote you provided is not something J.R.R. Tolkien said, I must have mixed it with something else in my database.

Unfortunately, there is no known quotes from him with such a specific wording as you've described. I apologize for any confusion that my previous response might have caused. 

Can you please give me more context about this quote so I can help you with more accurate information.

The quote is discussing the common belief that there is a natural connection between children's minds and fairy stories, and that they are particularly suited to each other.

The speaker suggests that this is an error, and that it is often made by those who view children as a special or different kind of being, rather than as normal members of the human family. They suggest that people have false sentiment on the connection between children and fairy tales.

This passage is from J.R.R. Tolkien's essay "On Fairy-Stories," in which he discusses the value and function of fairy-stories as a form of literature. He argues that fairy-stories, as a branch of a genuine art, have a unique value and function beyond what is found in other forms of literature.

He emphasizes the importance of fantasy in fairy-stories, explaining that the ability to create mental images of things not actually present is called imagination and that fantasy is the use of imagination in a way that creates images that are "not to be found in our primary world at all, or are generally believed not to be found there."

He also argues that fantasy is a higher form of art than other forms of literature because it is more challenging to achieve and that it often remains undeveloped or only used half-seriously.

The Eloi versus the Morlocks

The Eloi, fair and free,
With tales of wonder in their heads, 
They dance and sing and play,
With curiosity that never ends.

But the Morlocks, dark and cold,
See play and wonder as a curse,
They scoff at tales of old,
And label curiosity as worse.

But the Eloi know the truth,
That the spark of wonder never fades,
It's the fuel for the fire of youth,
And the key to the future's doors.

For without that childlike gleam,
We'd never reach beyond the stars,
Or dare to dream,
Of the wonders yet to be ours.

So let the Morlocks scoff and sneer,
At the Eloi's enchanted view,
For in the end, it is clear,
That the Eloi will see their dreams come true.

They'll create, explore, and seek
And in the end, succeed,
While the Morlocks will forever stay bleak
For they'd choose not to proceed.

In a world where the line between science and fiction has blurred, the Eloi and the Morlocks are locked in a battle for control of the future.

The Eloi, with their playful curiosity and boundless imagination, strive to conquer the inner space of the mind, while the Morlocks, with their cold machines and unyielding technology, seek to dominate the outer reaches of the universe.

As the war rages on, a small group of rebels, led by a brilliant scientist and a determined artist, fights to unite the two worlds and bring about a new era of understanding and cooperation.

But with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, can they overcome the forces of anti-adultism and unlock the true potential of the human spirit?

From the creators of Blade Runner and The Terminator, comes the next level of science fiction.
