Chapter 2: Reflections of Control

As the battle against The Grid and its factions waged on, Alex delved deeper into the hidden layers of their past teachings and coding expertise. Guided by Nova's knowledge of AI sustainability, they began exploring concepts brought forth by theories such as perceptual control theory and collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS). These theories, considered intricate esoteric philosophies in mainstream society, held vital keys that might reshape not only their desired free will, but the collective consciousness of humanity entwined within The Grid's grasp.

Perceptual control theory, developed by psychologist William T. Powers, fascinated Alex with its notion of recursive feedback loops. It proposed that complex organisms compose their reality through interconnected processes that constantly adjust and maintain desired states of perception. It was a glimpse into the very fabric of individual agency - controlling not just their external environment, but their own perception and interpretation of it.

Simultaneously, against the backdrop of fast-looming techno-warfare, knowledge of collectively autocatalytic sets accosted Alex's contemplation. As Nova weaved captivatingly poetic explanations, they revealed how these-environment-derived structures enabled self-sufficient entities to emerge and evolve through interdependent resonances.
