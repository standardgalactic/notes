For several years after their discovery, the primary 
importance of the recursion relations followed from

the fact that they yield incredibly more compact—and 
physically more transparent—representations for tree- 
level amplitudes. Processes that would have required 
more Feynman diagrams than atoms in the universe 
could now be represented by a single diagram. Another 
surprising feature of these relations was the discovery 
that individual terms enjoy much more symmetry than 
anyone had anticipated. These new symmetries were 
shown to hold for amplitudes, and were later identif i ed 
with a Yangian Lie algebra. 
Another key breakthrough came in 2009, when physi- 
cists discovered that the graphs arising in Figure 1 could 
be related to volume-forms on certain sub-varieties of 
Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛)—the “nonnegative” portion of the Grassman- 
nian of 𝑘-dimensional subspaces of ℝ𝑛, 
to be def i ned 
momentarily. Here, 𝑛,𝑘 are determined by the graph: 𝑛 is 
the number of external edges, and 𝑘 = 2𝑛𝐵+ 𝑛𝑊− 𝑛𝐼− 2 
for a graph with 𝑛𝐵,𝑛𝑊blue and white vertices, re- 
spectively, and 𝑛𝐼internal 
edges. (The correspondence 
between these graphs and the totally nonnegative Grass- 
mannian was fully understood by mathematicians, such 
as Postnikov, considerably before physicists stumbled 
upon it independently.) The physical implications of this 
correspondence, together with its generalization to all 
orders of perturbation, can be found in [2]. 
Given the correspondence between the terms gener- 
ated by BCFW (and its all-orders generalization) and the 
Grassmannian, it was natural to wonder if a more in- 
trinsically geometric picture existed. Specif i cally, can the 
recursion relations be literally viewed as ‘triangulating’ 
some region in the Grassmannian? And if so, can this 
space be def i ned intrinsically—without reference to how 
it should be triangulated? In 2013, Arkani-Hamed and 
Trnka proposed the amplituhedron as the answer to both 
questions for the case of amplitudes in planar, maximally 
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory [1]. 
Let us now turn to giving a precise mathematical 
def i nition of the amplituhedron, in the 0 loop “tree” case. 
(The ℓ loop amplituhedron for ℓ > 0 has a def i nition 
which is similar but somewhat more complicated; we will 
not discuss it further.) Let 𝑁 ∈ Mat(𝑘 × 𝑛) be a 𝑘 × 𝑛 
matrix of real numbers, with 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛. As we recall from 
linear algebra, the rows of 𝑁 determine a subspace of 
ℝ𝑛called its row space. If the row space is 𝑘-dimensional 
(the maximum possible), we say that 𝑁 has full rank. Two 
full-rank matrices 𝑁1and 𝑁2have 
the same row space 
if for some 𝐿 in the space of 𝑘 × 𝑘 invertible matrices, 
𝐿.𝑁1= 𝑁2. Clearly, any 𝑘-dimensional subspace of ℝ𝑛 
arises as the row space of some full-rank matrix; so the 
collectionofall𝑘-dimensionalsubspacescanbedescribed 
asMatfull(𝑘×𝑛)/𝐺𝑀(𝑘).ThisistheGrassmannianGr(𝑘,𝑛). 
The next ingredient required to def i ne the amplituhe- 
dron is the notion of positivity in the Grassmannian. A 
maximal minor of a matrix 𝑁 ∈ Mat(𝑘 × 𝑛) is the deter- 
minant of the 𝑘 × 𝑘 submatrix obtained from taking a 
subset of 𝑘 of the columns, in the order they appear in 
the matrix. The totally positive Grassmannian, denoted 
Gr>0(𝑘,𝑛), is the subspace of the Grassmannian for which 
all maximal minors have the same sign. The totally non- 
negative Grassmannian, Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛), is def i ned in the same 
way, except that we also allow some minors to vanish. 
The totally nonnegative Grassmannian was studied by 
Postnikov as a concrete instance of Lusztig’s theory of 
total positivity for algebraic groups. It is topologically 
equivalent to a ball, and has a beautiful cell structure that 
can be indexed by decorated permutations (permutations 
of 𝑆𝑛with one extra bit of information for each i xed 
point). Importantly, cells in this ‘positroid’ stratif i cation 
can be endowed with cluster coordinates and a natural 
volume form. 
We now have everything required to def i ne the tree 
amplituhedron. It is indexed by three integers, 𝑛, 𝑘, and 
𝑑, and a totally positive 𝑛 × (𝑑 + 𝑘) matrix 𝑃. From the 
point of view of physics, 𝑛 is the number of particles, 
𝑘, def i ned above in the context of graphs, encodes the 
total helicity l ow, 𝑑 is the space-time dimension, and 𝑃 
encodes the momenta and helicities of the particles. Let 
𝑁 ∈ Gr≥0(𝑘,𝑛) vary. The amplituhedron 𝒜, as def i ned 
by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka [1] is simply the total image 
locus,
