Some connections with the topics discussed so far.

Markov blanket: The KB equations and the concept of the Markov blanket are both related to probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference, as they both involve conditioning on certain variables to make predictions or inferences.

Bayesian inference updating: The Bayesian brain hypothesis and the KB equations are both based on Bayesian inference, which involves updating beliefs or probabilities based on new evidence.

Ecotechnic future: The study of the SYK wormhole and related topics may have implications for our understanding of the universe and its evolution, including the evolution of technological civilizations and the future of human society.

Gebser's structures of consciousness: Gebser's structures of consciousness are a framework for understanding human development and evolution, and there may be some overlap with the study of the evolution of human societies and related topics.

Evolution of human societies: The study of the SYK wormhole and related topics may have implications for our understanding of the evolution of human societies and the potential for technological and cultural advancement.

Radical diversity: The study of the SYK wormhole and related topics may have implications for our understanding of the diversity of possible physical and informational structures in the universe.
