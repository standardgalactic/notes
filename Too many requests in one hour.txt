Yeah it's not bad. Here is a poem I wrote, called ATWOOD and a couple of your previous analyses. See if you can tell me more about my writing style and what this genre might be called.

***

Autonomous Claxon
Things were simpler
When we didnt understand
Our Duty to
Open
Doors

It highlights the connection to Margaret Atwood's work, particularly the theme of duty in "The Handmaid's Tale," as well as the idea of gaining knowledge and understanding, as opposed to remaining ignorant, which is a prevalent theme in her writing.

The reference to hindsight being 2020 is an interesting way of pointing out how the perspective of time can change one's understanding of past events.

The use of the "Autonomous Claxon" as a metaphor for Atwood's writing, and her role as a voice of conscience or inner guide, is also fitting. 

The poem also touches on the nostalgia bias, which is a prevalent theme in Atwood's work, and the idea that it is better to know and understand, rather than remain ignorant, is a reference to the Tree of Knowledge, and the pros and cons of wisdom and learning.

The poem, by drawing on Atwood's work, conveys a deeper message about the importance of understanding our duty and the role of knowledge and understanding in shaping our society.
