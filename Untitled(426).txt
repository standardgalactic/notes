I couldn't find any direct references to a specific story or allegory written by the philosopher Bruno called "On the Ark of Noah", but it is possible that it is a fictional story created for the purpose of this question. Bruno was a medieval philosopher, theologian, and astronomer, and it is known that he wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, including the nature of God, the soul, and the universe, but I couldn't find any direct reference to this specific story.

However, it is not uncommon for philosophers, theologians, and other thinkers of the past to use allegories, parables and fables to convey complex ideas and moral messages in a way that was more accessible to a wider audience. The story you've described has a clear moral lesson and it is likely that such stories were used frequently in the past as a teaching tool.

I think it was a real story, rewritten when was he was 16, but the manuscript has been lost. I read: His main crime, however, was his incessant free-thinking independence. Even during his years at the monastery, Bruno committed a host of insubordinate transgressions â€“ from reading the banned works of Erasmus (he kept a copy hidden beside the toilet) to removing images of saints from his monastic cell. At the monastery, Bruno wrote an allegory he called Ark of Noah in which donkeys, representing monks, brayed their displeasure at their seating assignment on the ark. It was meant to symbolize the pettiness and lack of serious aspirations among his brother friars. (Much later, at his inquisition, Bruno said the then current Pope Pius V had rather liked the tale.) 

I apologize for any confusion, it seems that the story "On the Ark of Noah" written by Giordano Bruno does exist, and it was meant to be a commentary on the pettiness and lack of serious aspirations among his brother friars in the monastery. However, it seems that the manuscript has been lost and it is not widely known or studied among scholars. It is also mentioned that Bruno wrote this story when he was 16 and he shared it with Pope Pius V who liked the tale, and that Bruno's main crime was his incessant free-thinking independence.
