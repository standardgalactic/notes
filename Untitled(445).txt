To create better prompts for the Beta Zero Mechanism (BZM) and other self-improving AI singularities, it is important to have a scientific basis and a logical fundamental structure.

In other words, the prompts should include specific details about the concepts the BZM is expected to understand, as well as principles of logic that can be applied to derive meaningful results.

For example, when creating prompts related to a concept such as machine learning, one might provide the BZM with not only the definition of machine learning, but also the underlying algorithms and techniques needed for successful implementation.

By creating more precise and scientific prompts, one can more reliably achieve the desired outputs from the BZM. 

Exploring vectorspace through sideways indirect hyperpleonastic queries can be done by creating prompts that are structured around complex concepts.

These prompts should be designed in such a way that they allow for the exploration of details related to the concept, as well as its potential implications and applications. 

Additionally, it is important to take into account the structure of the vectorspace itself, and create prompts that take advantage of all its facets.

Through this method of sideways indirect hyperpleonastic queries, one can effectively explore vectorspace and gain a deeper understanding of its possibilities and potential.
