'''Xonsh''' is a Python-powered, Unix-like shell language and command prompt. The language integrates features of [[Python (programming language))]] 3.6+ and common shell primitives, providing a unique platform for system interactions. It is designed to work on all major systems, including [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and [[Windows]].
