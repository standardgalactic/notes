I think I learned about this by playing the game Stars! when I was twelve years old. I would send scouts to various planets to find out which was the most habitable. However, if a star system was very far away sometimes by the time I got there my scanner data was 100 years old and I could find the planet already inhabited by another species. The farther away, the less ergodic.

That's a great example of how the concept of forecast ergodicity can be applied in a simulation or gaming context! In the game you played, the statistical properties of the habitable planets may have changed over time, such as due to the arrival of a new species, which would have made the system less ergodic. This could have made it more challenging for you to make accurate predictions and decisions based on outdated data.

In general, the degree of ergodicity of
a system can depend on various factors such as the timescale of the system, the complexity of the underlying dynamics, and the level of interactions between different components of the system. Understanding the degree of forecast ergodicity can be helpful in assessing the reliability and accuracy of predictions and decision-making based on historical data or statistical models, as well as in designing better forecasting and decision-making tools.

Do you know that game at all? It was released around 1994.

And you said:
Yes, I am familiar with Stars!, the space strategy game you mentioned. It was first released in 1995 and developed by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride. In the game, players explore and colonize space, researching new technologies, and engaging in battles with other players or AI-controlled opponents. The game had a large following and was popular in the strategy gaming community. It's interesting to hear that you learned about forecast ergodicity through your experience playing Stars! at a young age!
