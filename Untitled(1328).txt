I thought about it a little bit more.

I'm sorry for putting you through all this emotional anguish. Just answer the phone when he calls and agree to whatever his terms are. He will say something I agree to not let someone sleep in the shed.

He wants to go on a trip to Bali in a month or two so he wants to store his stuff somewhere. He promises to put all the stuff into the room.

Try to tell him you are worried about inspectors coming around maybe.

Really, I didn't anticipate he would put up such a fuss, he wants to make it difficult and so if you have a phone call he'll convince you, if he can't get a hold of you on the phone he will try to talk to in person to convince you. It's kind of an insane way to react he really didn't anticipate it or think about it before.

I think where he doesn't know where he wants to live it will shake him up a bit, he has been pondering moving to nova scotia. He kind of threatened to cause a hassle and a stink and then took it back later when he realized how it sounded.

Just talk to him when he calls and see if you can work things out because he doesn't know what all the issues are. I am perfectly fine with him being around he just needed a shock to know it's not okay to sleep someone in the shed. He said he already warned Dave that he might have to scramble. As crazy at it sounds he thinks he knows what all the factors are.

Do not mention my mental health that shouldn't really be a concern I am just acting frenetic to get his attention that something is wrong, but I'm not worried about my mental health I'm perfectly fine, I am just acting annoyed so he will clean up and stop sleeping someone in the shed so if you can straighten that out with him things will be fine.

I will see you before then maybe not really I didn't know he would be so adamant to stay like he kind of panicked but he immediately calmed down and acted more rational and suggested solutions.
