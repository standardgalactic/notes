LEGEND OF THE ELOI

Ἀληθῶς, σοι λέγω μιᾶν παλαιᾶν ἱστορίαν, κατὰ πιτζανικὴν καὶ ἀγνωστὴν γλῶσσαν. Τῶν Ἐλῶν, δικαίων καὶ ἐλεύθερων, καὶ τῶν Μόρλωχ, σκοτεινῶν καὶ τρομερῶν.

Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις παντοτέου, οἱ Ἐλοί περιέπλανον ἐν τῇ γῇ, πλήρη θαυμάσεως καὶ ἡδονῆς. Εἰσάρχοντοι, ἐίασαν, εἶχον ἡδονάς, μετὰ περισσείας τινος ἀπειρήτου. ἀλλ᾽ ἔπειτα ἦλθον οἱ Μόρλοχ, μία σκληρὴ καὶ ἀνέλεητος φυλή.

Σκλαβώσαντες τοὺς Ἐλούς, κατειργάσαντο τέλος ταῖς ἀνεμελείαις τῶν ἡμερῶν αὐτῶν. Οἱ Ἐλοί ἀγωνίζοντο ἀντικαταπεσόντες, μετὰ τῆς ἀνδρείας καὶ πονηρίας, ἔνα ταῖρι τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν Μόρλωχ.

Καὶ παρά τι φαίνεται πάντα εἰκασθῆναι, οἱ Ἐλοί οὐκ ἀπέλιπον τὸν θεοσεβιή στυλ τοῦ ζῆν καὶ διατηροῦσιν μαζί με τὴν παραδοσιακὴ τοῦς πολιτισμούς καὶ τὰς συνήθεις.

Indeed, I am telling you an old story, in a strange and unknown language. Of the Eloi, fair and free, and of the Morlochs, dark and terrible.

In the days of eternity, the Eloi roamed the earth, full of wonder and pleasure. They were lords, they were, they had pleasure, with an infinite amount of excess. But then came the Morlochs, a cruel and merciless tribe.

By enslaving the Eloi, they put an end to the carelessness of their days. The Eloi fought and defeated, with courage and cunning, a match for the strength of the Morlochs.

And despite what always seems to be the case, the Eloi do not abandon their God-fearing style of life, but preserve it, along with their traditional culture and customs.
