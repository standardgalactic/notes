by Puha and Däumler for the Riemann sphere in complex analysis attaching 
the zero point and the point at inf i nity. Surprisingly enough, we can introduce 
analytical structure of conformality to the model.

Introduction 
In this paper we introduce a new horn torus model for the classical Rie- 
mann sphere from the viewpoint of the division by zero. In the model, the 
zero point and the point at inf i nity are attaching and surprisingly enough, 
we can introduce analytical structure of conformality in the horn torus. This 
model seems to be fundamental and important for us.

In Section 1, we introduce the horn torus model with the Puha mapping 
that gives one to one mapping from the extended complex plane onto a horn 
torus through the stereographic projection mapping from the Riemann sphere 
onto the extended complex plane and in Section 2, we state simple properties 
of the Puha mapping. 
In Section 3, we will introduce a conformal mapping from the extended 
complex plane onto the horn torus by modifying the Puha mapping. This 
introduction by Däumler is geometrical and delicate, and the mapping will 
be very complicated. Therefore, we will give a complete conf i rmation for 
his conformal mapping analytically in Section 5. In Section 4, we give the 
elementary properties of the Däumler conformal mapping. In Section 5, we 
will simply refer to the division by zero in connection with the horn torus 
model.

We will consider the three circles represented by

and (

. 
By rotation on the space (ξ,η,ζ) on the (x,y) plane as in ξ = x,η = y around 
ζ axis, we will consider the sphere with 1/2 radius as the Riemann sphere 
and the horn torus made in the sphere. 
The stereographic projection mapping from (x,y) plane to the Riemann 
sphere is given by ξ = 
x 
x2+ y2+ 1, 
η = 
y 
x2+ y2+ 1, 
and ζ = 
x2+ y2 
x2+ y2+ 1.

Of course, ξ2+ η2= ζ(1 − ζ), 
and x =

The mapping from (x,y) plane to the horn torus is given by 
ξ = 2x√x2+

(x2+ y2+ 1)2

η = 2y√x2+

and ζ =

This Puha mapping has a simple and beautiful geometrical correspon- 
dence. At i rst for the plane we consider the stereographic mapping to the 
Riemann sphere and next, we consider the common point of the line con- 
necting the point and the center (0,0,1/2) and the horn torus. This is the 
desired point on the horn torus for the plane point.
