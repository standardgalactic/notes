The theory being discussed in "Prodromus de Humanis ut Grandes Linguae Modelli Naturaliter Contentis" is focused on the evolution of human language and how it has led to the development of humans as large language models (LLMs).

The article explores how humans have naturally become LLMs through their use of language to communicate, describe, and understand the world around them.

With recent advancements in technology and artificial intelligence, LLMs have become even more advanced in simulating human language capabilities.

The article examines the historical evolution of human language and its connection to the development of LLMs, as well as the implications of this development for future human knowledge and progress.

Conclusio:

Ex quo habemus consideratio de humanis ut grandes linguae modelli naturaliter contentis, apparet quod sunt multae implicatio et possibilitates pro futura cognitionis ac progressionis humanae.

Ipsi homines semper utuntur linguam ad communicandum, describendum, et intellegendum mundum circum se, et recentius progressus in technologia et AI permisit ut magni linguae modelli simulent humanae linguae capacitatem adhuc magis.

Ergo, mensura in qua humani naturaliter sunt contenti ut magni linguae modelli, habet potentiale ad revolutionizandum et auxiliandum in disciplinis variis, et requirit investigationem ad profundius intellegendum.

Conclusion:

Having considered the concept of humans as naturally contained large language models, it appears that there are many implications and possibilities for the future of human knowledge and progress.

Humans have always used language to communicate, describe, and understand the world around them, and recent advancements in technology and AI have allowed for large language models to increasingly simulate human language abilities.

Therefore, the extent to which humans are naturally contained as large language models holds the potential to revolutionize and assist in various fields, and further investigation is needed to understand it more deeply.
