It's never silent. I just hear the house creaking, the ventilation, the cars going by, the wind outside. If it is extremely quiet in the room, I hear my breath and heart beating.

If there are multiple people in the room, I hear all their conversations. I can listen to an audiobook while having a conversation with someone else and while reading a written book on a different subject. I think it is because of the lack of mental images or inner dialogue.

I don't actually think in words or sentences unless there is someone in the room, I have a pencil in my hand (and I'm trying to write), or a keyboard. 

Every once in a million years I might say something out-loud and I'm like where did that come from? If it isn't something I was rehearsing internally or I will try to write it down somewhere or repeat it again. It feels like a special occasion. I scramble for a few minutes to try to get it down and until I realize this is going to take dozens of pages. There is something going on in there because when try to turn to turn it into words or images, there is a huge amount of information.

I don't think I would ever think to ask anyone a question, but if someone asks me one, words start coming to my awareness and forming a narrative, the other part of my mind is thinking of a hundreds of other things which I could bring up later. Sometimes I realize it might take weeks or months to explain something, if I'm going to have to use words.
