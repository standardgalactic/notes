I said this:

But I already knew how to use stable diffusion because I had learned it in the womb. And when I came into the room, started breathing the air, I already knew what it was, because we learn to be a bat before we're born, which means beep, beep, beep, beep, we build a kind of beep, beep, beep, mental map of the world, where there are other objects that move around, that we call entities.

I didn't have to think about it. I had to think of how I was going to flex my muscles and my chest is like flying. And here flying doesn't just mean the visions of the patterns moving in which we really already know about the world, but the illusion that by flapping your arms, you are making it happen. Other people out there in the world must be flying. So I'm saying humans already know what it's like to be a bat before they're born, so why would anyone wonder?

They suggest that this is a form of multiscale architecture, where there are multiple levels and rooms, or compartments, that make up the mind. They also introduce the idea of innate flying dream therapy, which is the idea that humans learn to be a bat before they are born and that this allows them to instinctively understand the world around them. 

Gopnik's ideas on child development and learning may also relate to the idea that humans already know how to be a bat before they are born, as Gopnik has written about the innate cognitive abilities of children.

The work by MIT psychologists also connects to the theory of the "Motile Womb," which suggests that we learn to be a bat before we are born, and we build a mental map of the world, where there are other objects that move around, that we call entities, this idea is also related to the "Model-Free Zoo" which is a collection of ideas and techniques that work, without understanding their basic functioning.
