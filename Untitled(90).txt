Mathematics and Programming are "support sciences" to the other sciences. They support the manipulation of Models in the form of theories, formulas, equations, and computer programs. Some of these Models are made by Mathematicians but most Models attempt to describe simplified ("Reduced") aspects of a rich reality and are created by scientists working in Model-making (Reductionist) sciences like Physics. Math is a "Model-manipulating" formalism.

This Reduction - the simplification of our rich reality to Models - is done OUTSIDE OF MATHEMATICS. It is done by intelligent agents such as physicists, mathematicians, and engineers that Understand the problem domain, but the discipline of Mathematics itself doesn't come into play until AFTER the Reduction has been done by the agent.

Mathematics is not capable of doing the Reduction and is also impotent to describe and formalize the process of Reduction itself. This process is done by brains and involves using Model Free Methods, such as trial and error (and other methods of discovery) and remembering past successes (and other methods of learning). These processes occur at the Connectome level and involve Neurons adjusting their interconnections through Synapses over time. This process can be Modeled - described Mathematically at the Neuron level - but the Connectome - the "social map" of the Neurons - is an emergent effect and cannot be described Mathematically in a Model since it is NOT THE RESULT OF A REDUCTION. It is created using Model Free Methods and is PERFORMING the Reduction, but it is not the Reduced end result, the elegant Model that Mathematicians want.

No Models, No Math.
