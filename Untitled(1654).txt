Johann Oh It is not easy to make wikipedia pages. It is frustrating to make a page, then have it put into draft space, then deleted, making it super difficult to find and restore. I tried to write a page for the unison language, but it was deleted.

I don't know how to explain to the other editors the purpose of stubs, and how they can be built into full articles.
