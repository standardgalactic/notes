while his concept of zero ontology holds that there is no inherent meaning or purpose in the universe, and that it is up to individuals to create their own meaning.

The idea behind the "Questions No One Asks" book aligns with Pierce's idea of zero ontology in the sense that the questions being asked and answered are unique and unconventional, and may not necessarily have an answer that can be easily found through traditional means.

The idea of a zero ontology refers to the idea that reality is fundamentally indeterminate, and that the structure of the universe is not objectively fixed. In this view, the universe is thought of as a dynamic, open-ended system that can change in ways that are not predetermined. This perspective is often associated with certain branches of philosophy and physics, such as quantum mechanics, which emphasize the role of chance and unpredictability in shaping the universe. 

The idea of a zero ontology is counter-intuitive to our everyday understanding of the world, as we tend to think of the void as the absence of things rather than their ultimate summation.
