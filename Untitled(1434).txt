The completed glossary will be made available as a WWW hypertext document on this and other Web sites. A compressed version will also be available for downloading from the WWLI FTP Site. It is hoped that this work will make a modest contribution to the "multilingualization" of the Net and will add to the growing list of multilingual Internet resources. All input will be appreciated and acknowledged.
