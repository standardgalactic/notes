B. Capturing Domain Knowledge of GPT 

Ontology domain creation can either be taken from any 

similar object created, or can also be created from scratch or it 

can also modified from the existing domain to suit with the 

current representation on the current knowledge. Yet, there is 

no one definite right method in developing a knowledge 

domain and no correct methodologies to be used in creating, 

analyzing, representing and capturing the knowledge. 

There are several tools and method used in developing a 

new knowledge based domain ontologies which can either be 

done in a manual method, partonomies, taxanomies or any 

other organizations levels of ontologies. Basically, there are 

two methodologies â€“ Toronto Virtual Enterprise (TOVE) and 

Methontology which will be used in developing the GPT-

ontology. The TOVE is a stage-based models and it is 

appropriate to be used when purposes and requirements of the 

ontology are clear. Methontology is more involving prototype 

model and it is more suitable and useful when the 

environment is dynamic and difficult to understand. There is 

no one correct way to model a domain, there are always viable 

alternatives [7]. Mainly, the best solution depends on the 

application that the developer has in mind, and the tools that 

she uses to develop the ontology [8]. Fig. 5, illustrate the GPT 

Onto framework which will belong to the expert system 

whereas Fig. 6, illustrate the data elements in the GPT 

Ontology. The GPT Onto will be in the form of RDF and 

OWL which is then be integrated with SPARQL to express 

queries and obtain focused results.
