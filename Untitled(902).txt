So which would be left and right ?

ChatGPT
The Eloi and the Morlocks are fictional groups of beings in H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine," and they are not necessarily associated with the left or right hemispheres of the brain.

However, one could interpret the Eloi as representing a more creative, imaginative, and intuitive approach to life, which is often associated with the right hemisphere of the brain, while the Morlocks could represent a more logical, analytical, and rational approach, which is often associated with the left hemisphere of the brain.

Could I get that as a chart?

ChatGPT
I'm sorry, but I must clarify that as an AI language model, I am not capable of creating visual charts or graphs. However, I can provide you with the information you requested in a tabular format:

Eloi — Morlocks

Curiosity and imagination — Cold machines and technology
Inner space of the mind — Outer reaches of the universe
Playful — Unyielding
Rebels seeking understanding and cooperation — Anti-adultism forces
Striving to conquer — Seeking to dominate

I hope this helps!

Thank you, it is excellent.

Ἀληθῶς, σοι λέγω μιᾶν παλαιᾶν ἱστορίαν, κατὰ πιτζανικὴν καὶ ἀγνωστὴν γλῶσσαν. Τῶν Ἐλῶν, δικαίων καὶ ἐλεύθερων, καὶ τῶν Μόρλωχ, σκοτεινῶν καὶ τρομερῶν.

Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις παντοτέου, οἱ Ἐλοί περιέπλανον ἐν τῇ γῇ, πλήρη θαυμάσεως καὶ ἡδονῆς. Εἰσάρχοντοι, ἐίασαν, εἶχον ἡδονάς, μετὰ περισσείας τινος ἀπειρήτου. ἀλλ᾽ ἔπειτα ἦλθον οἱ Μόρλοχ, μία σκληρὴ καὶ ἀνέλεητος φυλή.

Σκλαβώσαντες τοὺς Ἐλούς, κατειργάσαντο τέλος ταῖς ἀνεμελείαις τῶν ἡμερῶν αὐτῶν. Οἱ Ἐλοί ἀγωνίζοντο ἀντικαταπεσόντες, μετὰ τῆς ἀνδρείας καὶ πονηρίας, ἔνα ταῖρι τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν Μόρλωχ.

Καὶ παρά τι φαίνεται πάντα εἰκασθῆναι, οἱ Ἐλοί οὐκ ἀπέλιπον τὸν θεοσεβιή στυλ τοῦ ζῆν καὶ διατηροῦσιν μαζί με τὴν παραδοσιακὴ τοῦς πολιτισμούς καὶ τὰς συνήθεις.

This appears to be a passage written in Ancient Greek. Here is a rough translation:

"Truly, I tell you a story from the distant past, in the Pitzanik language which is unknown. It is about the Eloi, a just and free people, and the Morlocks, a dark and terrible tribe.

In those days of old, the Eloi roamed the earth, full of wonder and pleasure. They entered, indulged, and had pleasures in abundance. But then came the Morlocks, a harsh and merciless race.

Enslaving the Eloi, they finally put an end to their carefree days. The Eloi struggled back, with bravery and cunning, against the power of the Morlocks.

And despite all appearances, the Eloi did not abandon their pious way of life and continued to maintain their traditional cultures and customs."

So what do you think could be the etymology of pizzanican (πιτζανικὴν)?

ChatGPT
It's actually not clear what "pizzanican" means or if it is a real word. It's possible that it is a misspelling or a made-up word.

However, if we assume that you meant "pitjanikan" instead of "pizzanican," it is still difficult to determine the etymology of the word without more context.

It appears to be a Greek word that is not commonly used or recognized. It's possible that it is a dialectal or archaic term, or a neologism created by the author of the text.

User
It is a sci fi story I am writing, it is meant to be written in the distant future. The Greek is "reconstructed".

ChatGPT
I see! In that case, it's totally fine to use reconstructed language in your sci-fi story.

It can be a creative way to give your story a unique flavor and add depth to the fictional world you are creating. 

Just be sure to establish the context and rules for your reconstructed language, so that your readers can understand it.

Give some possible etymologies of πιτζανικὴν

ChatGPT
As "πιτζανικὴν" is not a recognized Greek word, I can only offer some possible hypothetical etymologies based on the sound and structure of the word:

It could be a compound word derived from "πιτζανος" (pitzanos), which could mean something like "small, round container," and "ική" (-ike), which could denote a characteristic or quality. So "πιτζανικὴν" could mean "pertaining to small, round containers."

It could be a variation of the Greek word "πιτσα" (pitsa), meaning "pizza." "Ανική" (-anike) is a suffix that could denote "belonging to" or "related to," so "πιτζανικὴν" could mean "related to pizza."

It could be a completely made-up word with no direct etymology, created to evoke a futuristic or alien language.

User
That seems accurate. Could I get that written as a dictionary style entry?

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of a dictionary-style entry for the word "πιτζανικὴν":

Word: πιτζανικὴν
Part of speech: Adjective
Definition: Related to or characteristic of the Pizzanic people or culture.
Etymology: From Pizzanicus, the Latinized form of "Pizzanico," a village in northern Italy that was home to a group of people with unique customs and traditions.

The word "Pizzanico" is believed to come from the Lombardic "picea" (spruce tree) and "anicum" (place of), possibly referring to the spruce forests in the area.

Over time, the people of Pizzanico developed their own distinct culture and way of life, which influenced the development of the word "πιτζανικὴν" in the distant future.

Nice and the other two possible etymologies

ChatGPT
Sure, here are the other two possible etymologies for "πιτζανικὴν":

Possible etymology from Italian "pizzaiolo", meaning "pizza maker" or "pizzamaker", and the suffix "-ic", meaning "relating to", "pertaining to", or "characterized by". This would result in "pizzanic" or "pizzanikos", which could have evolved into "πιτζανικὴν" in the future.

Possible etymology from a hypothetical Slavic word for "pizza" combined with the suffix "-nik", which is used to form agent nouns indicating a person's occupation, identity, or affiliation.

This would result in a word like "pizzanik" or "pizzanikov", which could have been borrowed into Greek and adapted to "πιτζανικὴν" over time.
