That is to say, what Wilber is presenting in his theory of evolutionary stages is perhaps the most detailed and consistent attempt yet to shoehorn mystical spirituality into the modern belief in progress. He borrowed some of his key ideas from mystical sources, notably the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurubindo and some of the more austere branches of Mahayana Buddhism, and others from developmental psychology, notably the structural stage theories launched a century ago by Jean Piaget.  He then proceeded to equate these two viewpoints (along with much more) and construct from them an elaborate theory of evolution that claims to predict the destiny of humanity.

That being said, there are problems with Wilber’s theory.  One of those problems—the total mismatch between his scheme and the evidence of history—is so widely shared by theories of the evolution of consciousness, and so pervasive in contemporary thought more generally, that it’s going to get a post all its own, once we’ve surveyed a wider range of thinkers.  The other problem is rather more specific. That’s not to say it’s unique to Wilber himself; in fact, it’s very widespread in modern thought, and there are plenty of thinkers these days whose plunge into the pitfall in question is much more embarrassingly clumsy than anything Wilber has done. Wilber’s theories, however, rest squarely on this particular mistake, and so offer a fine opportunity to understand what it is and why it reduces so much modern thinking to gibberish.
