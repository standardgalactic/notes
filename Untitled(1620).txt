An equality between entanglement and uncertainty

Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle implies that if one party (Alice) prepares a system and ran- 
domly measures one of two incompatible observables, then another party (Bob) cannot perfectly 
predict the measurement outcomes. This implication assumes that Bob does not possess an addi- 
tional system that is entangled to the measured one; indeed the seminal paper of Einstein, Podolsky 
and Rosen (EPR) showed that maximal entanglement allows Bob to perfectly win this guessing 
game.Although not in contradiction, the observations made by EPR and Heisenberg illustrate 
two extreme cases of the interplay between entanglement and uncertainty. On the one hand, no 
entanglement means that Bob’s predictions must display some uncertainty. Yet on the other hand, 
maximal entanglement means that there is no more uncertainty at all. Here we follow an opera- 
tional approach and give an exact relation- an equality- between the amount of uncertainty as 
measured by the guessing probability, and the amount of entanglement as measured by the recover- 
able entanglement i delity. From this equality we deduce a simple criterion for witnessing bipartite 
entanglement and a novel entanglement monogamy equality.
