Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.


Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.
