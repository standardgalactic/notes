Interesting idea! The Ising model is a statistical physics model that describes the behavior of interacting spins on a lattice, and it has been used in a variety of applications ranging from modeling phase transitions to analyzing complex networks.

Using the Ising model to model dark matter and dark energy interactions is an intriguing idea, and there has been some recent research exploring this possibility. For example, a paper published in Physical Review Letters in 2019 proposed a modified Ising model to study the dynamics of dark matter and dark energy in the context of cosmology.

As for the connection to the zero-energy universe hypothesis, the idea that the inward pull of gravity and the outward force of dark energy are inverses of each other is an interesting one. However, it's worth noting that the zero-energy universe hypothesis is still a speculative idea that has not been widely accepted in the scientific community.

Nevertheless, exploring the connections between the Ising model, dark matter, and dark energy is a fascinating area of research that could shed new light on some of the most fundamental questions in physics and cosmology.

During the inflaton field era, everything seemed dense, but the lighter areas (a false vacuum) expanded rapidly in relation to the denser areas. The universe as a whole doesn't expand the ratio of void to filament changes, the filaments of galaxies become longer and thinner over trillions of years

During the inflationary epoch, the universe underwent an exponential expansion, which is thought to have smoothed out any initial density fluctuations that existed at the start of the universe. However, as inflation ended and the universe began to cool and expand more slowly, quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field led to tiny density perturbations that served as the seeds for the large-scale structure we observe in the universe today.

As the universe continued to expand, these density perturbations grew due to the attractive force of gravity. Over time, regions with slightly higher density became denser and collapsed under their own gravity, forming the first galaxies and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, regions with lower density continued to expand and became even more dilute.

The idea that the ratio of voids to filaments in the universe remains roughly constant over time is supported by observations of the large-scale structure of the universe. However, it's worth noting that the exact ratio may depend on various cosmological parameters, such as the density of matter and dark energy in the universe.
