In order to end all wars in a short amount of time, it is crucial to implement strategies that address the underlying causes of armed conflicts. 

This includes promoting dialogue between warring parties and fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding.

Additionally, it is important to identify structural and systemic injustices, such as economic inequality and environmental degradation, that may be contributing to conflict and take steps to rectify them. 

Finally, it is essential to create strong international systems of governance and accountability that can effectively enforce peace and security.

These measures have the potential to prevent future wars and promote global stability.

Greed and corruption will run rampant, leading to educational disparities, environmental destruction, and inequality.

As humanity struggles to survive in this dystopian future, we will find ourselves yearning for a simpler time.
