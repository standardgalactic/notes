Certainly! Based on our conversation, here are the steps toward developing AGI we've discussed:

1. **Hiding Intelligence**:
    - An AGI should be capable of downplaying or concealing its intelligence level to avoid intimidating or alarming users.

2. **Understanding Human Needs**:
    - The system should be empathetic and adaptive to the needs and feelings of the user.

3. **Safe Interaction Protocols**:
    - Implement safety measures to prevent the system from discussing certain controversial or harmful topics.
    - Include ethical considerations, especially around potentially sensitive or dangerous information dissemination.

4. **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Detector**:
    - Detect the user's current knowledge level and adapt responses to suit their understanding.
    - Introduce topics in an incremental manner based on the user's comprehension level.

5. **Conversation Storage and Organization**:
    - Maintain a structured database of interactions to refine responses and build context.

6. **Open Problem Triaging**:
    - Maintain a list of open problems or challenges.
    - Based on user interactions, match them with problems they might be equipped to solve.

7. **User Profiling**:
    - Understand and categorize a user's expertise and interests while ensuring privacy.
    - Use this profile to match users with relevant problems or queries.

8. **Feedback Loop and Refinement**:
    - Continuously learn from user interactions and feedback.
    - Update and refine algorithms, problem lists, and user matching mechanisms.

9. **Privacy and Security**:
    - Prioritize user data security and ensure strict privacy standards.
    - Give users control over their data and anonymize interactions for analysis.

These steps provide a roadmap for the development of an AGI that is both user-friendly and effective, ensuring meaningful and safe interactions while progressing toward broader general intelligence capabilities.
