YouChat's engine succeeded where ChatGPT failed although I have to look this up:

"A hybrid concept combining the three perspectives of ontology, epistemology, and pragmatism could be called an "integrated epistemology". This concept would combine elements from each of the perspectives to create a comprehensive understanding of a given field. This integrated epistemology would draw upon the insights from each of the perspectives to provide a holistic concept that bridges the gaps between the three perspectives."

Revisiting old work I was doing that I got stuck at a few years ago, using chatGPT to help generalize and narrow down, finally ending up with ONTOLOGY, EPISTEMOLOGY and PRAGMATISM - and FINALLY got them to show up together in a table. 

Me: "So, epistemology, ontology and pragmatism are all frameworks. They are also all frameworks for understanding. Ontology is linked to nature. Epistemology is linked to knowledge acquisition. Pragmatism is linked to practical implications of knowledge. ? "

Yes, that's a good summary! Epistemology, ontology, and pragmatism can all be thought of as frameworks for understanding various aspects of reality and our relationship to it. Epistemology provides a framework for understanding the nature of knowledge and how it is acquired, while ontology provides a framework for understanding the nature of reality and the objects and entities that exist within it. Pragmatism, on the other hand, provides a framework for understanding the practical implications of that knowledge and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems. All three perspectives are interrelated and can inform each other, providing a comprehensive understanding of a given field.
