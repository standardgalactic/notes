Additionally, the effects of entropy and mass wasting, such as erosion, can lead to the loss of nutrients and resources, making it more difficult for life to survive and thrive, much like the flood reduced the resources available to life on Earth.

Overall, the parable of the sower and the story of the flood can both be used as metaphors to help understand the principles of natural selection and the survival of the fittest.

These examples suggest that some people have interpreted the parable of the sower as reflecting a concept similar to natural selection, where not all seeds grow in the same conditions and therefore only some seeds survive and flourish.

** Mention one and two are from Darwin's writing, he isn't talking about evolution per se, but he seems impressed by it as a metaphor. **

That is correct. Mention one and two are from Robert Southey's "History of Brazil" and Charles Darwin's notes respectively, and they do not explicitly mention evolution, but they use the parable of the Sower as a metaphor to describe the spread of religion.

In both cases, the authors are highlighting the idea that for a seed to grow and flourish, it must be carefully tended to and not left to chance.

This idea can also be applied to the spread of an idea or belief. The metaphor is being used to illustrate that for a religion or idea to take root and spread, it must be properly nurtured and sustained.

And so, Theano and Pythagoras continued their work, always challenging each other and striving for a deeper understanding of the mathematical world.

They never gave up on their quest, and eventually, they discovered a proof that was as elegant as it was powerful. Theano named the proof "the Dragon's Tooth" proof, and it became one of the greatest contributions to mathematics of all time.

** Explain how Jesus' parable of the sower can be used as a model of natural selection.

The flood can also be seen as a representation of the reductive effect of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting.

The flood was a catastrophic event that wiped out most life on Earth, leaving only a select few individuals and species to survive and reproduce. 

This is similar to how natural selection works, where only the fittest individuals and species are able to survive and reproduce in a changing environment. **

In the parable of the sower, Jesus describes how a farmer sows seed and some of it falls on good soil and produces a plentiful harvest, while other seed falls on rocky ground or is eaten by birds and does not produce any fruit.

This parable can be seen as a model of natural selection because it shows how only the seed that falls on the right soil and conditions will survive and produce a harvest, while the other seed will not.

Similarly, in the context of natural selection, only the individuals and species that have the right adaptations and traits to survive in a changing environment will be able to survive and reproduce, while others will not.

The flood can also be seen as a representation of the reductive effect of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting.

Just as the flood wiped out most life on Earth, leaving only a select few individuals and species to survive, natural selection operates by reducing the number of individuals and species in a population, leaving only those that are able to adapt and survive.
