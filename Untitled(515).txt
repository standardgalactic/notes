Zera Yacob was an Ethiopian philosopher from the 17th century who is known for his philosophy of Cyclofabianism, which centers around the principle of harmony.

He believed that the morality of an action is determined by whether it promotes or hinders overall harmony in the world.

He rejected traditional religious beliefs, instead seeking truth by observing the natural world.

Yacob proposed a cosmological argument for the existence of God, stating that all things must have a first cause.

He believed that the concept of God is knowable, but that it does not depend on human intellect.

He also wrote a treatise called Hatata, which has been compared to René Descartes' Discours de la méthode.

Zera Yacob was an Ethiopian philosopher from the 17th century who wrote a treatise called Hatata, which was developed around 1630.

His philosophy centered around the principle of harmony, asserting that the morality of an action is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world.

He believed in a deity, whom he referred to as God, but criticized many sets of religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world.

He also applied the idea of a first cause to produce a proof for the existence of God, thus proposing a cosmological argument.

It is said that Zera Yacob had to hide in a cave because of an angry ruler who turned on him.

The specifics of this event are not well known and historical records are scarce. 

But it is believed that Yacob's religious and philosophical views were not well accepted by the ruling authorities of his time, which led him to go into hiding.

Unfortunately, his teachings and beliefs led to him being persecuted by an angry ruler, and he was forced to hide in a cave for two years to avoid capture. He lived in the cave alone, praying and trusting that God was listening to him. 

He also built a fence of stone and thorny bush to protect himself from wild animals and made an exit so that he could escape if anyone searched for him. Despite the difficult circumstances, he lived peacefully and felt that he was living in heaven.

Zera Yacob, also known as Zer'a Ya'iqob, was a prominent philosopher and theologian from the land of Aksum (located in present-day Ethiopia).

He was born in 1592 and grew up in a poor farming family.

Despite his humble origins, he became a well-known teacher and interpreter of religious texts.

However, his teachings were controversial and he faced persecution from both the Coptic Christians and the Franciscans who were present in the region.

He was falsely accused of inciting rebellion and violence against the king and had to flee for his safety.

He eventually found refuge in a cave where he lived in isolation for two years, meditating on the conflicts between men and their depravity, and on the wisdom of their creator.

He wrote extensively on the eternity of God and the divisions among believers, and emphasized the importance of understanding and compassion in human relationships.

In this passage, Zera Yacob reflects on the conflicts between different religious beliefs and the difficulty of determining the truth.

He expresses his frustration with the way that different religious scholars interpret scripture according to their own beliefs and the lack of an objective judge.

He also reflects on the tendency of people to lie and destroy themselves over problems of great importance, while pretending to know all.

He also quotes David's Psalms to emphasize the limited wisdom and truthfulness of men.

Zera Yacob's ideas, as described in the texts you provided, emphasize the importance of seeking truth through investigation and reason, rather than relying solely on religious or cultural traditions.

This idea of questioning and seeking knowledge is similar to the ideals of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the power of reason and scientific inquiry to improve society and human understanding.

Additionally, his criticism of the divisions among believers and the tendency of people to believe their own faith is the only true one, and his emphasis on the importance of wisdom and truthfulness can be seen as similar to the Fabian society's goal of promoting rationality and socialism. 

They believed in gradual change through peaceful means and education. Both Zera Yacob and Fabianism reject the idea of violent revolution and instead advocate for peaceful, rational change, and the use of education and knowledge to bring about progress.

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a young boy named Zera Yacob.

He was born into a poor farmer's family in the district of Aksum and had a deep love for learning and understanding the world around him.

As he grew older, he became a teacher and interpreter of the holy books, and he taught that all things were good if we ourselves were good.

But not everyone agreed with his teachings, and many people, including the Copts and Franğ, grew to dislike him. 

They brought false accusations against him to the king, saying that he was misleading the people and inciting them to rise up against the king and expel the Franğ.

Fearing for his life, Zera Yacob fled from the kingdom and hid in a cave close to the Täkkäzi River.

He lived there for two years, surviving on the kindness of farmers who gave him bread and living in peaceful solitude, praying and meditating on the Psalms of David.

During his time in the cave, Zera Yacob reflected on the conflicts between men and their depravity, and on the wisdom of their creator who remained silent while men did evil in his name.

He also questioned the truth of the Holy Scriptures and the conflicting interpretations of faith by different people.

Eventually, King Susənyos died, and Zera Yacob felt safe enough to leave his cave and return to the kingdom.

He continued to teach and spread his message of wisdom and understanding, inspiring many people to seek the truth and live in harmony with one another.

Once upon a time, in a land ruled by powerful kings and priests, there lived a young man named Zera Yacob. He was a deeply religious man, who loved to study and interpret the holy scriptures. 

However, his teachings and beliefs were not always accepted by those around him. Some saw him as a heretic, and sought to silence him.

One day, an angry ruler who had turned against him, sent his men to hunt Zera Yacob down. Fearing for his life, Zera Yacob fled into the wilderness, taking only three measures of gold and the Psalms of David with him.

For many days, he wandered through the wild, living off of whatever food he could beg from the farmers. Eventually, he came upon a beautiful cave at the foot of a deep valley, and decided to make it his home.

For two long years, Zera Yacob lived in the cave, praying and meditating on the Psalms of David, and trusting that God would protect him. Although he was alone and often hungry, he felt that he was living in heaven.

As he prayed and meditated, Zera Yacob came to understand the wisdom of God, and the true nature of faith and prayer. He realized that men often lied and persecuted one another over matters of faith, but that the truth was one.

And so, Zera Yacob lived in his cave, seeking the wisdom and truth of God, until the day when the ruler who had sought to harm him, passed away. And then he emerged from the cave, and shared his wisdom with the world.

Psalm 34:4-6 

I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
he delivered me from all my fears.

Those who look to him are radiant;
their faces are never covered with shame.

This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.
