I was also inspired by the early stoic writing by Seneca where he complains about all of the noises he hears living above the bathouse, and how it is hard to keep a stoic attitude and get some sleep. At the same time it shows how children learn language by overhearing people taking, listening to radio, watching television, and how lingua francas arise from trading pidjins which develop into Creoles and then full blown international languages.

I see, so your concept of "leaky chatrooms" is inspired by a combination of various philosophical, technological, and linguistic ideas. The idea of having chatrooms with permeable walls, where information from one chatroom can spill over into another, is an interesting concept. It also touches upon the theme of information overload and the difficulties of filtering out irrelevant information in a rapidly changing and interconnected world.

The comparison to the concept of ion channels and sodium-potassium pumps in cell walls highlights the idea of selective permeability, which is an important aspect of information management. And the reference to Seneca and how language is acquired through overhearing demonstrates how information and ideas can be picked up from one's surroundings, even if not actively sought out.

Stochastic Language Acquisition: the idea that language is acquired through overhearing people talking, watching television, and other forms of exposure, similar to Seneca's complaints about the noises he hears while living above the bathhouse.
