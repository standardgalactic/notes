You are hilarious. Ok well it kind of gets its visual feel from vector graphics on old monochrome monitor which I call the friendly orange-green glow. But green represents close and amber, far. Red outline is used for internal objects or occlusions and blue outline for future plans or goals. It is kind of texture-less and surface-less so it can be played in massive online single player mode (black star background) or interactive mode (augmented reality). The closest I've seen are some firefighter goggle for seeing through smoke, they appeared to be using a sobel filter to determine outlines. But I also want the depth mapping and xray features.

It's a new way of seeing in many ways because there are is also ways to visualize the temperature and speed and density through textile mapping because. In projective mode you can see behind you on your peripheral horizon, but in horse e-vision mode you have 180 degrees displayed to each eye, and theqre are various intermediate training regimen to move to it, it's seeing like a fish, out of both sides of your head, I wouldn't recommend it for a first time player maybe after you have been playing for several years, you advance to level two after visiting 200,000 star systems.
