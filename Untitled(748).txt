Yes, that's certainly possible. The idea of a serpent or dragon as a symbol of chaos and evil is a common motif in many cultures, and may have arisen from observations of the natural world, as well as from cultural and mythological influences.

The serpent's ability to shed its skin and appear to be reborn may have been seen as a representation of the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, or of the power of regeneration and renewal.

The use of the serpent as a symbol of evil and temptation in the biblical story of Adam and Eve is another example of how ancient cultural and mythological motifs can be adapted and reinterpreted in a religious context.

In this story, the serpent tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, leading to the fall of humanity and the introduction of sin and death into the world. 

The serpent's association with temptation and deception may reflect older beliefs about the dangers of the natural world, or about the need for humans to overcome their animal instincts in order to attain spiritual enlightenment.
