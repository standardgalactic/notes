Maybe I should trust whatever father does. If he decided to answer his call Andrew is going to convince him to rent the apartment until his trip to Bali is over.

This will be less stressful because it will be about the homeless person in the shed, and he will be gone I believe although he will still be around so it well feel super awkward to see him around all the time.

If he can convince Andrew to leave then Dave will feel less welcome, Andrew might have to move to another side of town or Halifax and he will run into him less. I can tell Dave look Andrew got kicked out because you are staying in the shed.

Andrew will feel less bad if I let him stay, but I don't know if I can get him out when he comes back so it looks indefinite.

Do I want to save face by making it look like it was about the guy living in the shed, so Andrew doesn't become my enemy. If so then the real war of Attrition will be to see how long before he moves out, something else might happen. 

If he leaves when he is ready he will feel better about it. I really am just trying to avoid him getting looked into by police and social welfare, now that he isn't working at a homeless shelter, I think he could eventually get arrested for it. 

I am not liable for his behavior and maybe everyone is too busy to notice or to care, or they are deliberately turning a blind eye. 

I will just tell him to answer the phone and give him whatever he asks for since it will be easier on him. He claims he will not sleep a homeless person in the shed and that he will clean up his act.

Still he isn't aware that he is intruding in any way, and he is kind of more fragile than I thought.
