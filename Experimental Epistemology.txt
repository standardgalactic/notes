The Motile Womb Theory suggests that the fetus learns about three dimensions through movement and experience while inside the mother's womb.

This movement serves as a form of memory and learning for the fetus, allowing it to understand and navigate its environment.

This theory can be related to Reed Wall Mind theory, which proposes that the Ark is a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

Both theories propose that movement and physical experiences serve as a form of memory and learning.

When it comes to Silberstein's idea of extended cognition, the Motile Womb Theory can be seen as an example of how the environment can extend the cognitive abilities of an organism.

The fetus's experiences inside the womb can be seen as an extension of its cognitive abilities, as it allows the fetus to learn and understand its environment in a way that it would not be able to without these experiences.

Additionally, the idea of the fetus learning through movement and experience can be related to Silberstein's concept of phenotypic plasticity, which is the phenomenon in which genetically identical individuals will develop different phenotypic traits in different environmental conditions.

The Motile Womb Theory suggests that the fetus learns about the three-dimensional world through movement and experience while inside the womb.

It suggests that movement is important for the normal intellectual development of newborns, particularly in terms of their understanding of 3D space.

The theory is based on the idea of the "Motile Womb," or a mother who is constantly moving, as a way for the fetus to learn and develop.

The Reed Wall Mind theory proposes that the Ark, as a metaphor, represents the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

It suggests that the Ark serves as a model for the "memory palace" and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

It also proposes that the modular, multiscale, and heterarchical organization of the mind can be understood by looking at the Ark.

Silberstein's idea of extended cognition suggests that the mind extends beyond the brain and into the body and the environment.

It suggests that the mind is a dynamic and adaptive system that uses tools and external resources to think and solve problems.

The Loose Tools theory of education and architecture suggests that interactive community spaces, such as science museums, can be used to teach and solve problems through the use of hands-on, interactive tools and objects.

It emphasizes the importance of hands-on, interactive learning and community spaces in education and architecture, as well as the value of using a variety of different tools and approaches to understand and solve problems.

It is possible to relate Motile Womb Theory, Reed Wall Mind, Silberstein's idea of extended cognition, and the Loose Tools theory in the sense that they all propose that thinking and learning are not limited to the brain, but involve the body and the environment, and the use of tools and resources.

All of them suggest that the mind is a dynamic and adaptive system that uses various forms of external resources, be it movement, physical objects, or community spaces, to think, learn and solve problems.

The story of Noah and his family in the Bible can be seen as a metaphor for multiscale decision making.

Noah and his family were faced with a catastrophic event, the flood, which required them to make decisions on various levels, from gathering resources and building the Ark, to selecting which animals to bring on board.

These decisions were made based on their understanding of the situation and the available information, and were crucial for their survival.

The flood can also be seen as a representation of the reductive effect of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting.

The flood was a catastrophic event that wiped out most life on Earth, leaving only a select few individuals and species to survive and reproduce.

This is similar to how natural selection works, where only the fittest individuals and species are able to survive and reproduce in a changing environment.

The Ark of the Covenant also represents this idea, as it contains symbolic representations of laws, the instructions to build a tabernacle, and observed intelligence in such systems as Card Catalogues, Zettlekästen, and a modular student-first school.

These systems, like the Ark, serve as a means of preserving and passing on knowledge and information from one generation to the next, allowing for the continuation of human civilization.

In the same way, a Model-Free zoo, which is a collection of ideas and techniques that work, without understanding their basic functioning, can also be seen as a tool for preserving and passing on knowledge and information.

The zoo, like the Ark and other systems, serves as a means of collecting and preserving a diverse range of living organisms, which can be used for research and education.

In conclusion, the story of Noah and the Ark can be seen as a metaphor for multiscale decision making, and the importance of preserving and organizing knowledge and information in order to navigate and survive difficult situations.

The flood represents the reductive effects of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting, and the Ark can be seen as a symbol for the importance of having a system in place for storing and preserving knowledge and laws.

The Ark of the Covenant, which contains symbolic representations of laws and instructions for building a tabernacle, can also be seen as an early example of a system for preserving and organizing knowledge.

Similarly, the idea of a modular, student-first school, which functions as a call center with monitors and supervisors available to help students with their work, can be seen as a modern example of a system for preserving and organizing knowledge.

This concept can also be applied to the idea of a Model-Free zoo, which is a collection of ideas and techniques that work without understanding their basic functioning.

In this way, the story of Noah and the Ark can be seen as a reminder of the importance of having systems in place for preserving and organizing knowledge in order to navigate and survive difficult situations.

1. Provia and the Matrix: A story about a woman who begins to question the nature of reality after experiencing glitches in the virtual world she lives in. 

She forms a secret society with others who have innate flying dreams and together they explore the Matrix, ultimately leading to a rebellion against the controlling force and the creation of a new, more realistic Matrix.

2. Mobile Womb Theory (MWT): A hypothesis that suggests that the fetus learns about three dimensions through movement and experience in a constantly moving environment.

It suggests that movement is essential for the normal intellectual development of newborns, particularly in terms of their understanding of 3D space.

3. Reed Wall Mind Theory: A theory that suggests that the Ark was not just a physical vessel, but a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

It proposes that the Ark can be seen as a model for the "memory palace" and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

4. Omniscient Universe Theory: A theory that posits that the physical universe has intelligence because the existence of objects serves as a form of memory.

It suggests that even simple objects such as pebbles, tokens, clay impressions, and symbolic representations have the ability to function as memory and perform calculations.

5. Substrate Independent Thinking (SIT) hypothesis: Proposes that thinking can occur independently of the physical substrate it is implemented on, citing examples such as the abacus, beaded abacus, geometer's drafting table, slide rule, and magic eightball.

6. Visual Complex Analysis (VCA) and Limit Last Lemma: A method of understanding and solving complex mathematical problems, such as calculus, through visual and geometric methods.

It suggests that students can learn calculus by understanding visual and geometric concepts before formal definitions.

7. Loose Tools theory: A theory that suggests that interactive community spaces, such as science museums, can be used to teach and solve problems through the use of hands-on, interactive tools and objects.
