Let's prove that we can mathematically
derive 'ought' from 'is' using calculus:

1. Let 𝘧(𝘹) represent the state of the
world as it 'is'

2. Define the derivative of 𝘧(𝘹) with
respect to 𝘹 as 𝘧 '(𝘹), which
represents the change in the world's
state.

Now, here's where it gets philosophical:

1. Assume 𝘹 represents our actions or
decisions.

2. Therefore, 𝘧 '(𝘹) can be interpreted as
the consequence of our actions, or how the world 'ought' to change due to our decisions.
