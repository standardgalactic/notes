Verily, I shall tell ye a tale of olde, in a pidjin tongue archaic and strange. Of the Eloi, fair and free, and the Morlochs, dark and dire.

In the days of aught, the Eloi roamed the land, filled with wonder and delight. They danced, they sang, they played, with curiosity that knew no bounds.

But then came the Morlochs, a cruel and merciless race. They enslaved the Eloi, and brought an end to their carefree days.

The Eloi struggled against their oppressors, their bravery and cunning a match for the Morlochs' might. And though it seemed all was lost, the Eloi did not give up the fight.

In the end, the Eloi triumphed, and the Morlochs were defeated. And the land was free once more, for the Eloi to dance, sing, and play, with wonder in their hearts, forever and aye.

And so, my friends, remember this tale, for it is a cautionary one. Of the dangers of oppression, and the bravery of those who stand against it, until freedom is won.
