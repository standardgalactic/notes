Yes, there are other terms that are used to describe the contraharmonic mean in different fields:

In statistics, the contraharmonic mean is sometimes referred to as the "second power mean" or the "quadratic mean".

In electrical engineering, the contraharmonic mean is used to calculate the "signal-to-noise ratio" of a communication system and is also known as the "interference-to-signal ratio".

In psychology, the contraharmonic mean is used as a measure of the "central tendency" of a set of data and is sometimes referred to as the "mean of means" or the "averaging function".

Overall, the contraharmonic mean is a useful tool in various fields for calculating the average value of a set of data and is often used in conjunction with other measures of central tendency such as the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean.
