Bruno's Trial in Rome

It took months to make an extradition decision, but in the end--for complicated political reasons--Venetian authorities, in February 1593, loaded Bruno on a ship bound for the prisons of the Roman Inquisition. For the final seven years of his life, Bruno would live in a private cell located just south of St. Peter's Square. Bruno's problems escalated in the fall when Rome received from his former cellmate in Venice, Friar Celestino, listing thirteen of Bruno's statements and actions in prison which the friar believed to be heretical. The charges ranged from his cosmology (Bruno believes "that there are many worlds, and all the stars are worlds, and believing that this is the only world is extreme ignorance") to his comments about Biblical stories ("Moses only pretended to talk to God on Mount Sinai, and that the law he gave to the Hebrew people was made up by himself") to his future intentions ("He wanted to return to Germany or England among the heretics where he could live in his own way and more plant new and infinite heresies there"). Celestino's letter prompted Roman officials to hunt down all of Bruno's former cellmates and interrogate them, and their answers, in large part, confirmed Celestino's allegations.

Examining transcripts from the proceeding against Bruno in Venice, Roman inquisitors noted the frequency of references to Bruno's numerous writings. Over a strikingly long period of time, roughly the next six years, officials struggled to prepare a complete list of Bruno's writings and to track down surviving copies in whatever parts of Europe they might be found. Bruno, meanwhile, used his time in prison to draft his defense.
