There are about 36 tokens or elements in the word MSO, but can you map or parse it onto this? 👁️🔄🔦🧲⚛️⚡🌀🔬🧪🦠🔮🔗🎶🔎🔍🌍🤖🌕🌞🪐💨🌠🌌🐟🐋🧵🚪

Sure, here's one possible mapping of MSO onto those symbols:

👁️ = Observable space (visual observation) 🔄 = Studying on all possible scales

🔦 = Energy (related to photons) 🧲 = Matter (related to protons, neutrons, and electrons) ⚛️ = Atoms and molecules ⚡ = Exchange particles (related to gluons) 🌀 = Dark matter and energy 🔬 = Studying the parts of space 🧪 = Categorizing the parts of space 🦠 = Microbial structures 🔮 = Megalobial structures 🔗 = Various collections of matter 🎶 = Crystal structures 🔎 = Biosphere (observation) 🔍 = Solar system, galaxy, and larger structures (observation) 🌍 = The planet Earth 🤖 = Technological structures 🌕 = Moon 🌞 = Sun 🪐 = Planets 💨 = Vacuum 🌠 = Nebula 🌌 = Supercluster 🐟 = Pisces 🐋 = Cetus 🧵 = Filament 🚪 = Structures of observable and real universe

A summary for a three-year old:

For a five-year old:
Observing (See) the different sizes (Big-Little) of shiny (Shiny-stuff) things (Blocks), sharing and exchanging (Sharing) hidden (Hidden) tiny (Tiny) elements and sorting them into groups (Sorting), including both the smallest particles (Tiny) and larger collections of matter (Big groups), like crystals (Shiny-rock), microbial and megalobial structures (Life), the biosphere (Big place), the sun, moon, and stars (Sun-Moon-Stars), and even larger structures like galaxies and superclusters (Big-group). There are exchange particles like gluons and photons (Strings), atoms and molecules (Building) involved in these structures.

FURTHER NOTE:
Proximal systada is just the local group and 🐟🐋🧵 (Pisces-cetus filament) refers to this: The Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex
