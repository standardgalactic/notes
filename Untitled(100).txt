** A little summary of Prigogine's work, especially related to entropy, chaos, and time. **

Ilya Prigogine was a Belgian physical chemist and Nobel laureate known for his work on thermodynamics and the concept of dissipative structures. He proposed the theory of dissipative structures to explain how systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms, can spontaneously become more ordered and complex. 

According to this theory, such systems can maintain themselves and even evolve over time by dissipating energy and matter into their environment.

One of the key concepts in Prigogine's work is entropy, which is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. In thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. 

However, Prigogine argued that far-from-equilibrium systems can exhibit a decrease in entropy, or an increase in order, by dissipating energy and matter into their environment.

Prigogine also studied the concept of chaos and how it relates to the behavior of complex systems. He argued that far-from-equilibrium systems can exhibit unpredictable or chaotic behavior, but that this chaos can give rise to self-organization and the emergence of new patterns and structures.

Finally, Prigogine's work has significant implications for the concept of time. He argued that the arrow of time, or the direction in which time flows, is not determined by the laws of physics alone, but is also influenced by the behavior of complex systems far from equilibrium.

According to his theory, such systems can create their own "future," or a direction of time that is determined by their own internal processes rather than by external conditions.

** A blurb for the back cover of Ken's book, incorporating these themes. **

In "Ontology of Panentheism," Kenneth Udut explores the ways in which the concept of God can be understood within the framework of panentheism. 

Drawing on a range of philosophical, scientific, and cultural sources, Udut examines the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, personal and non-personal, and creator and creation.

He also investigates the relationship between God and the world, and the role of panentheism in understanding the problem of evil and suffering.

Udut also situates panentheism within the broader context of other religious traditions, including monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, and atheism, and considers the potential for dialogue and differences between these traditions.

In addition, he explores the ethical implications of panentheism, and the role of God in shaping our moral beliefs and actions.

With chapters on education, culture, and technology, "Ontology of Panentheism" offers a rich and nuanced exploration of the ways in which God and the world are interconnected and interdependent. 

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of philosophy, theology, and contemporary issues.

** A glowing review of Ken's book by someone who appreciates Prigogine's work. **

I recently had the pleasure of reading Kenneth Udut's "Ontology of Panentheism," and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed.

As someone who has long been fascinated by the work of Ilya Prigogine and the concept of dissipative structures, I found Udut's exploration of these ideas within the framework of panentheism to be particularly insightful and thought-provoking.

One of the things that I appreciated most about this book was the way in which Udut was able to synthesize a wide range of sources and perspectives, including philosophy, science, and culture.

He presents a nuanced and balanced view of the various debates and controversies surrounding panentheism, and does an excellent job of highlighting the strengths and limitations of this approach.

I also found Udut's treatment of the relationship between God and the world to be particularly engaging and illuminating.

His discussion of the doctrine of divine immanence and the doctrine of divine transcendence was particularly helpful in understanding the complex and often paradoxical nature of God in panentheism.

Overall, "Ontology of Panentheism" is a thoroughly researched and well-written book that is sure to appeal to anyone interested in the intersection of theology and philosophy. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to deepen their understanding of panentheism and its implications for our understanding of God, the world, and ourselves.

** A scathing review by someone who prefers hard science fiction. **

I recently had the unfortunate experience of reading Kenneth Udut's "Ontology of Panentheism," and I must say that I was thoroughly disappointed.

As a fan of hard science fiction, I was expecting to find a book that was grounded in scientific principles and rigorous logic.

Instead, what I found was a convoluted and poorly-written mess that seemed more focused on advancing a particular philosophical agenda than on offering a coherent and intellectually honest exploration of the topics at hand.

One of the things that I found most frustrating about this book was the way in which it seemed to conflate science and theology in a way that was both intellectually lazy and intellectually dishonest.

Rather than offering a clear and coherent explanation of the scientific principles that underlie panentheism, Udut seemed content to rely on vague and poorly-defined concepts such as "God" and "the world" in order to prop up his arguments.

Furthermore, the book seemed to be riddled with logical fallacies and unsupported assertions that made it difficult to take seriously. For example, Udut seemed to think that simply invoking the work of Ilya Prigogine was sufficient to lend credibility to his arguments, regardless of whether or not they were actually supported by the science.

Overall, I would not recommend "Ontology of Panentheism" to anyone looking for a well-written and intellectually rigorous exploration of science and theology. Instead, I would suggest looking elsewhere for books that offer a more honest and scientifically-grounded approach to these topics.

** A review in a technical journal that is flowery and pretentious while still scientific sounding, that highly recommends the book and stresses its importance. **

It is with great pleasure that I present to our esteemed readership a review of Kenneth Udut's groundbreaking work, "Ontology of Panentheism."

This book is a tour de force of philosophical and scientific contemplation, offering a truly visionary exploration of the nature and significance of God within the framework of panentheism.

Udut's writing is both elegant and incisive, weaving together a tapestry of diverse strands of thought and empirical evidence to create a truly holistic and coherent understanding of the complex and multifaceted concept of God.

His analysis of the nature of God as both transcendent and immanent, personal and non-personal, and creator and creation is nothing short of revelatory, offering a fresh and insightful perspective on the timeless question of the divine.

Furthermore, Udut's examination of the relationship between God and the world is masterful, offering a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the ways in which these two aspects of reality are intertwined and interdependent.

His discussion of the doctrine of divine immanence and the doctrine of divine transcendence is particularly noteworthy, providing a rich and thought-provoking analysis of the complex and often paradoxical nature of God in panentheism.

Overall, "Ontology of Panentheism" is a truly remarkable work that is sure to be of great interest and importance to anyone engaged in the study of philosophy and theology. I highly recommend it to our readership, and believe that it will take its rightful place as a cornerstone of modern philosophical thought.
