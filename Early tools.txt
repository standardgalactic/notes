Editor’s summary

In 1981, the mandible of an infant hominin was discovered in the highlands of Ethiopia. Since then, its affinities have been debated, limiting our understanding of its importance. Using synchrotron x-ray imaging, Mussi et al. identified it as Homo erectus. This fossil is dated to 2 million years ago, and it is associated with both Oldowan and Early Archeulean tools, confirming that H. erectus used both types. This finding also reveals the use of high-elevation environments in this species, providing insight about the movement of hominins out of Africa. —Sacha Vignieri

Abstract

In Africa, the scarcity of hominin remains found in direct association with stone tools has hindered attempts to link Homo habilis and Homo erectus with particular lithic industries. The infant mandible discovered in level E at Garba IV (Melka Kunture) on the highlands of Ethiopia is critical to this issue because of its direct association with an Oldowan lithic industry. Here, we used synchrotron imaging to examine the internal morphology of the unerupted permanent dentition and confirmed its identification as H. erectus. Additionally, we used revised paleomagnetic ages to show that (i) the mandible in level E is ~2 million years old and represents one of the earliest H. erectus fossils and that (ii) overlying level D, ~1.95 million years old, contains the earliest known Acheulean assemblage.

The Melka Kunture complex consists of a cluster of prehistoric sites that extends over tens of square kilometers in the Upper Awash, on the Ethiopian plateau at ≥2000 m above sea level (asl) (Fig. 1A). At this high altitude, the Pleistocene climate would have been cooler and wetter than at the lower elevations of the Rift Valley, from where most fossil evidence for early species of Homo derives. The paleovegetation belonged to the Afromontane complex, ranging from forest to grassland and bushland (1), and the plant species were distinct from those of the African savanna, which developed at lower elevations in drier and warmer environments. The degree of topographic relief of the region meant that the highlands were relatively isolated, leading to the appearance of endemic mammal subspecies (2). In 1981, an infant mandible was discovered in level E of the Garba IV site, although which species of hominin it represents has been a subject of debate (3). In this study, we review the geochronological context of the Garba deposits, characterize the Oldowan and Acheulean lithic assemblages, present the paleoecological context of the site on the basis of analysis of the faunal assemblage and palynology, and reassess the taxonomic affinity of the mandible. Our aim is to determine when, how, and which hominin species was first able to adjust to the high-altitude environment of the highlands of Melka Kunture during the Early Pleistocene and the associated transition from the Oldowan to the Acheulean technocomplex. Broadening our knowledge of the environment at the time and not limiting it to the savanna and to lower altitudes is relevant to understanding how H. erectus was able to expand beyond Africa.
