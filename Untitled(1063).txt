Creation from Chaos: In the book of Genesis, God creates an orderly world out of chaos. This could be paralleled with the process of image compression, which takes a large, potentially unwieldy set of data (the original image) and brings order to it by condensing it into a smaller, more manageable format (the compressed image).

Noah's Ark and Saving Space: Noah had to make the most of the limited space on the ark, choosing only the most essential animals to preserve. This mirrors the task of image compression, which aims to preserve the most essential information in an image while discarding non-essential or redundant data to save space.

The Ten Commandments and Encoding: The Ten Commandments served as a compact, efficient encoding of moral law for the Israelites. Similarly, image compression involves encoding an image into a more compact representation.

The Prophets and Prediction: The Old Testament prophets predicted future events based on their understanding of God's will. In image compression, especially in predictive coding, the value of a pixel is predicted based on neighboring pixel values, helping in reducing the amount of data needed to represent the image.

Tower of Babel and Decoding: In the Tower of Babel story, a common language was "decoded" into many languages, causing confusion. In contrast, in image compression, the compressed image (which can be thought of as a coded message) is decoded back into its original form with the aim to minimize any loss or confusion.
