The boundary layer equations are derived by "zooming out" and comparing scales between the whole bulk of the system and the boundary layer area, while the no-slip condition is justified by "zooming in" to consider individual interatomic interactions. Separating the scales at which these conceptions operate in this case then suggests that it may be fruitful to think of the resulting boundary layer model as a multiscale model, which allows us to address the problem above using readily available tools for unpacking the epistemology of multiscale models

Treating surfaces as boundaries on bodies, particularly by modeling surfaces as mathematical boundary conditions, has been a remarkably successful strategy in the modeling of bulk materials. The success of this strategy has been a subject of philosophical investigation and a source of insight into the epistemology of modeling .

detoxification (Wilson 2006, pp. 545-552), asymptotic connections between patches (Batterman 2001;Wilson 2017), and Machian explications (Wilson 2012a;Carus 2012). Other promising ways of extending this framework would be to add linguistic and pragmatic contexts in order to model also Wilson's context-adjusting models of predicate extension (Wilson 1982(Wilson , 2012b or to merge Wilson-Structuralism with Carnapian Structuralism (Andreas 2014(Andreas , 2020 and with accounts of deductive reasoning in structuralist frameworks (Andreas 2013) in order to model Wilson's contextual notion of inference validity and logical inconsistencies
