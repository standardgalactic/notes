Imagine you have a little machine inside your head that helps you understand the world around you. This machine is like a small model of a big house with many rooms. Each room is like a little box that helps you understand different things, like colors, shapes, and sounds.

And just like how you go on a treasure hunt to find new toys, the little machine inside your head goes on a hunt to find new ideas and patterns. This is like a mini adventure, like playing a game where you try to find and understand new things.

This is what we call the Reed Wall Mind theory.

And just like how animals go on a big adventure on a boat called Noah's Ark, your little machine inside your head also goes on a big adventure to find new ideas and patterns.

So, both the Reed Wall Mind and Noah's Ark are ways to help you understand and explore the world around you in a fun and exciting way.

Imagine you're in your mommy's tummy before you're born. You can hear and feel things even though you're all cozy and safe inside. And you're learning about the world outside by experiencing it.

Just like when you hear a car honk or your mommy's voice, you start to understand what those things are and how they move.

This is the Motile Womb theory. It says that we start learning about the world before we are even born, by experiencing things in the womb. And that helps us understand more about the world when we finally come into it.

Just like when you go on a road trip, you learn a lot about the world by looking out the window, even though you're inside the car. The same thing happens in the womb.

Isn't that cool? You started learning about the world before you even took your first breath!
