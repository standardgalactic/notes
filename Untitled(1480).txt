Attribution theory, first developed by psychologist Fritz Heider, examines how people attribute causes to events and behaviors. A key concept in attribution theory is the fundamental attribution error, which describes people's tendency to over-emphasize internal or dispositional factors when explaining someone's behavior while underestimating external or situational factors. This cognitive bias can distort our self-perceptions. For example, when we succeed at something, we are more likely to attribute it to our own talents or personality traits rather than other factors like luck or ease of the task. This can lead to an inflated sense of our own abilities. Conversely, when we see others succeed, we tend to attribute it more to circumstantial factors like luck or ease of the task rather than their intrinsic abilities. This can lead us to underestimate others' competencies. 

Furthermore, the self-serving bias causes people to take credit for success but externalize failure. If we pass an exam, we see it as due to our intelligence, but if we fail, we blame the teacher for making it too hard. This can preserve our self-esteem but at the cost of accurate self-assessment. Together, the fundamental attribution error and self-serving bias act as "cognitive conceit," distorting our self-perceptions (Hastorf, Schneider & Polefka, 1970). Even when reflecting internally, our thinking is subject to attribution biases. Recognizing this can lead to greater self-awareness and humility. Carefully examining our implicit assumptions when attributing causes to outcomes, whether about ourselves or others, can counteract these tendencies and lead to more objective self-perception. A nuanced understanding of attribution theory principles sheds light on how our attitudes and self-concepts are formed.

Philosopher Peter Carruthers adds an important perspective on the biases of self-attribution. He argues that our beliefs about our own attitudes, emotions, and motivations are often mistaken because they rely on the same inferential processes we use to speculate about others (Carruthers, 2011). We don’t have special access to our inner thought lives. Rather, we interpret ourselves in similar ways to how we interpret others, leaving us prone to attribution errors. For example, when we reflect on why we acted a certain way, we are likely to settle on the most plausible explanation using attribution heuristics, rather than deriving the real “cause” through introspection (Carruthers, 2011). Furthermore, Carruthers suggests that our self-perceptions are subject to confabulation, reconstructing narrative explanations that make sense but may not reflect reality. So when attributing our behavior to personality traits or situational factors, we are susceptible to flawed causal reasoning and potential self-deception. Recognizing these attribution biases, even during inner reflection, can lead to more cautious self-appraisal and evidence-based self-perception, rather than relying on intuitive explanations that confirm our self-conceptions. Carruthers’ critique highlights the tenuous and convoluted nature of self-attribution.
