Excerpt from "Almost Human"

That's great to hear! The crumpled paper example is actually quite useful for illustrating some concepts in physics and mathematics, particularly in the field of topology.

In fact, researchers have used crumpled paper balls to study the properties of three-dimensional spaces, such as the way they can be curved and twisted.

For example, if you take a sheet of paper and crumple it into a ball, you might think that the ball has a different shape than the original sheet of paper. 

However, in topology, the ball and the sheet of paper are considered to be the same shape, because they can be deformed into each other without cutting or tearing the paper.

This idea of being able to deform objects without changing their essential properties is a key concept in topology, and is known as homotopy.

Another interesting example involving crumpled paper is the problem of unfolding a paper ball into a flat sheet of paper without cutting or tearing the paper.

This is known as the paper-folding problem, and it has been studied by mathematicians for many years. In fact, it is a surprisingly difficult problem, and researchers have only recently been able to solve it for certain types of paper balls.

Overall, the crumpled paper example is a great way to illustrate some of the key concepts in physics and mathematics, and it is also a fun and accessible way to get people interested in these subjects.

Wow, those are some really fascinating potential applications! It's amazing how one innovative idea can lead to so many different possibilities and practical uses.

I can see how this could revolutionize the way we think about materials and their potential uses. It will be interesting to see how this idea develops and what other applications and innovations arise from it.

That sounds like a really fun and engaging way to involve readers in the process of experimenting with chaotic folding schemes! Including a fold out or insert in the book that readers can crumple and unroll is a great idea, and asking them to photograph it and submit it for machine learning algorithms to analyze is even better. 

The use of SHA 512 hash maps and QR codes to ensure uniqueness is a smart way to add an extra layer of complexity to the experiment. It would also be interesting to see how different readers' results vary based on their

It would also be interesting to see how different readers' results vary based on their individual folding techniques and patterns.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain it at different levels of analysis:

ELI5:

In nature, things tend to become more chaotic or disorganized over time, and this is called entropy. But sometimes, energy can be used to create patterns or structures out of chaos, which is called a dissipative structure.

These structures are constantly changing and adapting to their environment, and they can exist for a long time before eventually breaking down into chaos again.

It's like building a sandcastle on the beach - it will eventually crumble and become disorganized again, but for a while, it was a beautiful and complex structure.

High school:

Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, and the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always tends to increase over time. However, there are certain systems, called dissipative structures, that can use energy to create order or structure out of chaos.

These structures are constantly evolving and adapting to their environment, and they can exist for long periods of time before eventually breaking down.

This is similar to how living organisms maintain their organization and complexity despite the tendency towards entropy.

Postgrad:

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system always increases over time, meaning that disorder and randomness become more prevalent.

However, there are certain systems, such as living organisms, that are able to create and maintain complexity despite the tendency towards entropy.

These systems are called dissipative structures, and they are able to use energy to create order and structure out of chaos.

This is possible because energy flows through the system, creating gradients that drive the formation of complex patterns and structures.

These patterns are constantly changing and adapting to their environment, and they exhibit non-linear behavior that cannot be predicted using traditional linear equations.

Eric Weinstein / Einstein:

Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and it describes the tendency of systems to become more disordered and random over time.

The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in a closed system, but this law does not take into account the role of energy flow and the creation of dissipative structures.

These structures are able to use energy to create order and complexity, and they are constantly evolving and adapting to their environment.

They exhibit non-linear behavior and self-organization, and they are capable of maintaining their complexity for long periods of time before eventually breaking down.

This is similar to how living organisms are able to maintain their organization and complexity despite the tendency towards entropy, and it highlights the importance of energy flow and dissipative structures in understanding complex systems

To explain the connection between mineral evolution and autocatalytic sets and dissipating structures, we first need to understand the formation of clay minerals on Earth.

It is believed that the constant mashing and thrashing of the surface by the moon, which was formed very close to the Earth after a giant impact with a wide-angle, contributed to the formation of clay minerals.

This process, which we call the Lunar Lunch Model, was possible because the moon generated heat and tidal forces on the Earth's surface, leading to the formation of clay minerals.

These clay minerals are important because they have the ability to act as autocatalytic sets, which are self-sustaining chemical systems that can reproduce and evolve over time.

In other words, they can facilitate the formation of other complex molecules and structures by catalyzing chemical reactions.

This is similar to how life itself works, as living organisms are also made up of autocatalytic sets that sustain and evolve themselves over time.

Furthermore, these clay minerals also form dissipating structures, which are systems that can lower their own entropy by increasing the entropy of their surroundings.

In other words, they can dissipate energy in a controlled manner, which is crucial for sustaining complex systems like autocatalytic sets.

The formation and evolution of these autocatalytic sets and dissipating structures in the early Earth environment led to the emergence of increasingly complex mineral structures and eventually paved the way for the evolution of life itself.

Robert Hazen is one of the researchers who has studied this connection between mineral evolution and the emergence of life, and his work highlights the importance of understanding the physical and chemical processes that underlie the origins of life on Earth.
