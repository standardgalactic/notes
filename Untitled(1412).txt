“… einem unendlich feinen Netzwerk” 
A small world with thirty nine “Elementarsatze” has 239 = 
549.755.813.888 truth-possibilities of propositions, an 
embryo of the “großen Spiegel”. And about “feinen Netz- 
werk”? 
List L1 is organized in top-down order considering the 
number of elements in a logical produc. L1 fits well the 
nodes of a 5-cube (Penteract),in a graph that is shown in 
the following address: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:5- 
cube_graph.svg . For a 12-cube (Dodekeract) the address 
is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:12-cube.svg . 
After visiting those addresses it is easy to understand 
why “…einem unendlich feinen Netzwerk”. But, is it all? 
No. There is a more important detail , that is: 
Applying the operation “or” in a pair of truth-possibilities 
with same number of “Elementarsatze” is found a truth- 
possibility with one more “Elementarsatz”. If we do the 
same in applying the operation “and” in a pair of truth- 
possibilities with the same number of “Elementarsatze”, is 
found a truth-possibility with one “Elementarsatz” less. 
These properties cover almost all Boolean algebra. 
How could Wittgenstein see it all without the tools of 
Modern Algebra?
