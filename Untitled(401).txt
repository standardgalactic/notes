I ran this through a few testers they leaned toward human although  was a little room for uncertainty. I used this Prompt I found on a Youtube video in preparation for this article then went and made a few minor changes on that. 
""When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?"

Music and AI: A Peek into the Future
Music and artificial intelligence (AI) have been intertwined since the early days of AI research. From the earliest computer-generated tunes to the sophisticated AI music composers of today, AI has been changing the way we make, listen to, and experience music. As AI technology continues to advance, it's becoming increasingly clear that it will play an even bigger role in shaping the future of music. But what exactly does that future look like? In this article, we'll explore the ways in which AI is changing music, the pros and cons for musicians, and what the future of music may look like.
Pros of AI in Music
One of the biggest advantages of AI in music is its ability to help musicians create new and innovative sounds. With AI algorithms, musicians can easily generate new musical ideas and experiment with different styles, genres, and instruments. This opens up a whole new cascade of creative possibilities that might not have been possible otherwise.
Another advantage of AI in music is its ability to automate repetitive tasks, such as editing and mixing. This can save musicians a significant amount of time and allow them to focus on the creative aspects of music making. In addition, AI can also help musicians overcome technical limitations, such as poor singing or playing skills, by automatically fixing mistakes or enhancing performance.
Finally, AI can also help musicians reach a wider audience. With the help of AI algorithms, musicians can create and distribute music more easily, and reach fans all over the world. This is especially important in today's digital age, where music is increasingly being consumed online.
Cons of AI in Music
While AI has many benefits for musicians, there are also some drawbacks to consider. One of the biggest concerns is the loss of the human touch in music. With AI algorithms doing much of the work, some fear that the music will become less personal and less emotional. This could possibly lead to a decrease in the overall quality of music and make it less appealing to listeners.
Another concern is the potential for AI to displace musicians. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it may become possible to generate music that is indistinguishable from music made by human musicians. This could make it difficult for musicians to cut out a living, as demand for their services may decrease.
Finally, there is also the issue of copyright and ownership. With AI-generated music, it's unclear who owns the rights to the music and who should be compensated for its use. This will at some point lead to disputes and legal battles in the future.
Benefits for Musicians
Despite these concerns, there are many ways in which musicians can benefit from AI technology. For one, AI can help musicians create new and innovative music that they might not have been able to create on their own. This could help them stand out in a crowded market and reach new audiences.
In addition, AI can help musicians automate repetitive tasks and save time, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of music making. This could make the process of creating music more enjoyable and less time-consuming.
Finally, AI can also help musicians reach a wider audience and distribute their music more easily. This could help them grow their fan base and increase their income from music sales and live performances.
The Future of Music and AI
In conclusion, it's clear , good bad or indifferent that AI will continue to play a major role in shaping the future of music. With its ability to help musicians create new and innovative sounds, automate repetitive tasks, and reach a wider audience, AI has the potential to be a major force for good in
