A Perfect Vacuum (Polish: Doskonała próżnia) is a 1971 book by Polish author Stanisław Lem, the largest and best known collection of Stanislaw Lem's fictitious criticism of nonexisting books.

U-Write-It: A literary erector set. It gives the reader blank pages and strips containing fragments of from great novels and orders the reader to re-arrange them at will. Similar to the cut-up technique used by the Dadaists and William S. Burroughs. The literary erector set didn't sell well, as the general public was actually uninterested in great novels.
