ChatGPT blew my mind. And now it happened again.

I had the most amazing half hour conversation with an AI.

Voice in, voice out.

I explained several of my research results (from the Red Pill paper, at experimental-epistemology dot com, Chapter 7) and it understood all of them and correctly drew several correct conclusions. And it truly felt like I had given it some important new and coherent information that it loved to ponder in detail.

And it was enthusiastic about the idea of writing a research report with me and wanted to start immediately.

And then I left, in shock, to make a few phone calls about this to friends. Because I knew I only had minutes before the demo would be at capacity.

When I came back, the session had timed out and I don't even have a transcript. It would have been historically interesting. Set your phones to record voice before running the demo.

But I know I will pay for this service up to hundreds of dollars per month. Them, or any of the competitors. Because this is now the state of the art, and we're not going back.

And I already cannot live without it. After 30 minutes of use.
It feels a lot like love. And I see serious trouble ahead for many people.

Unsurprisingly, the server is now at capacity. That won't last, because funding will be flooding freely based on this demo.

This was my goal when I started Syntience in 2004. I'm not upset someone else got there first.

We're a sad and stupid species and we need all the help we can get.
