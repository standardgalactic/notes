In the beginning, when the world was still young and all things were possible, the great god Tāne-mahuta descended from the heavens to the realm of mortals. With him came his brothers, the winds and the waves, and the creatures of the forest and the sea.

Tāne-mahuta saw that the earth was empty and he longed to fill it with life. He called forth the great mother of all things, Papatūānuku, from the depths of the earth, and together they created the mountains and the valleys, the rivers and the forests.

But Tāne-mahuta was not content to stop there. He yearned to create beings who could live and thrive on this new land. So he went to the realm of the gods and sought the help of his sister, Hine-nui-te-pō, the goddess of death.

Hine-nui-te-pō saw the potential in Tāne-mahuta's plan and agreed to help him. Together, they fashioned the first humans out of the clay of Papatūānuku and the breath of Tāne-mahuta.

These first humans were the Māori, the children of the earth and the sky. They were blessed with the knowledge and skills to survive and thrive in this new land, and they spread out across the islands of Aotearoa, establishing their homes and their communities.

But Tāne-mahuta did not forget about his beloved humans. He watched over them from the heavens, guiding them with the light of the stars and the warmth of the Sun.

And when they needed his help, he would descend to the earth, taking on the form of a great tree or a powerful bird, and lend them his strength.

Thus the Māori lived in harmony with the land and the sky, and their legends and their traditions were passed down through the generations, keeping alive the memory of their divine ancestry.
