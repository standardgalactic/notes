uh so the big question about artificial

intuition is first what is intuition and

when people speak about intuition they

speak about a form of knowledge

or having ideas where you don't really

know how we think that you come from

particular so the way to define which is

in ense to contrast it with its opposite

the opposite you might call this

rational thinking you have the famous

distinction made by car theel PR in

economics who speaks about system one

thinking system two thinking the system

two thinking is what we usually call

National think that mean to explicitly

form certain arguments in your mind and

and you follow the T of thought step by

step that means you use symbols which

typically are words which represent

certain entities or certain Concepts or

categories you have certain rules to

which you combine the SYM into

meaningful sentences or is called

propositions propositions are that

explicitly describe some kind of

situation and then you follow certain

rules

of logic or grammar to derive things

from other things there is this classic

example Cirus is human all humans are

moral therefore cus is moral so you have

the

symbol is you have the symbol human

symbol Mor you know that there are

certain rules of d by which you can make

sances like C is human humans are mortal

we have certain rules of work if all

humans are moral and Circ is human then

circus must be moral so for a very long

time cognitive science and artificial

intelligence was starting from this kind

symbolic paradig symbolic

paradig thinking explicitly step by step

and that was let's say until about the

1980s there was the IDE can represent

all knowledge by symbolic expressions

and the height of that let's say that

artificial intelligence was in the 1980s

the soal knowledge based systems or

expert systems they were trying to code

every knowledge we have about the world

in terms of these kind of propositions

so times kind of propositions that we

would want to have is for example a dog

is a mamal a mamal is an animal a mamal

is B blooded a dog bars a dog walks in

the streets and you would try to

describe everything there is to know

about the particular domain in

expressive propositions consisting of

abstract symbols that follow certain

rules why am I seeing something that is

not me I see everybody's watching a

screen where

is you need the white yeah so now it's

coming yeah oh the bottom sorry

funny this idea was that artificial

intelligence it necessarily

requires

La yeah it's muted so we need to we need

to can you st just in case of anything

right please can it can it be a little

bit louder the or the microphone or

maybe try Francis if you can try to

speak more in front when you turn the

head then is missing what you

say ah okay that's why

speak I'm sorry I know it's very

difficult it happens to me also if you

last

week please keep going it's now it's I

can see the the sound here so it's

okay uh so okay so we all in this

Paradigm which is called in cognitive

science the symbolic Paradigm knowledge

consists of symbols symbols are ComEd

according to certain

proposition proposition describe your

knowledge it describe what is to be

known about the real world and then

intelligent reasoning is making

inferences that means starting from some

proposition that you know to be true you

derive other propositions for example

knowing that dogs are MSS are animals

you can Den that a dog is a map is an

animal knowing that Ms are warm blooded

you can derive that the do is warm

blooded so that was the Paradigm in the

1980s of the so-called knowledge based

systems and because it's not obvious to

put in all the knowledge we have about

the world it started with soal expert

systems the expert system was meant to

represent expertise that means

specialized knowledge about the

particular domain and one of the typical

examples they were considering was

diagnosis of diseases if you are a

doctor you know that this disease can

have these and these symptoms and that

if you have a high temperature and you

have a cuff and you have this then you

may have uh an infection of the lungs

and so on so one thing they immediately

needed to do was not only

logical derivations where a necessarily

follows from B but also some degree of

probabilistic derivations if you have

these symptoms then you may have this

disease with this probability and this

other disease with this probability so

that was the Paradigm in the 1980s and

the idea was here the whole of

artificial intelligence the only thing

we need to to do is put in more and more

propositions more and more rules and

eventually we will have the knowledge of

the whole of humanity in our artificial

intelligence system and there is an

interesting project that started doing

it and that project is still Le it's

called psych made by the artificial

intelligence Pioneer Douglas L and the

idea was let's capture all the knowledge

about everyday things the kind of

knowledge that an average person has

into these propositions and that could

be very simple propositions like when it

aains the speed gets

when it rains people take an umbrella an

umbrella protects you against the rain

uh if somebody is

said uh they will not want to go to a

party and I mean you can think of

thousands millions and in the end

billions of these kind of compositions

and of course the pych project put

millions of these things into the system

and in thean yeah nobody has really

heard I suppose about the psych buet

they have put thousands of M into

collecting all this knowledge and yeah

practically not

used so nowadays we have artificial

intelligence systems that are much

better than that but they work according

to a completely different principle so

in artificial intelligence you have the

symbolic Paradigm the Paradigm of

explicit logical thinking and then you

had the connectionist or Neon Network

Paradigm and that is the Paradigm that

is more trying to imitate what happen in

the brain and that is precisely where

what we might call intuition is

happening because what is intuition

intuition is you certain you suddenly

have a certain Insight or a certain

feeling that something is going to

happen and you can't retrace the steps

you can't say what are the assumptions I

have made and what are the inferences I

have made to come to this conclusion the

conclusion is there it's kind of obvious

you see somebody you say oh that person

is said maybe they just had some bad

news and you go and you comfort that

person why did you think that that

person was

sad it's not obvious maybe the way the

person was moving kind of slowly and

looking kind of like this and not

reacting when you are ask

something you can recognize that person

is sad intuitively it's clear that that

person is

sad there wouldn't be any kind of an

expert system that you could put in

rules if the person's eyes are with this

angle down and if the person's movements

are slower than this and if this and

this then the person is that obvious

that doesn't work so the symbolic

Paradigm for uh artificial

intelligence it's I wouldn't say that

it's ourd it's still useful for certain

that can be formalized but the big

advantages advantage in artificial

intelligence like now all about this

neural network Paradigm so neural

networks get very quickly very

complicated mathematically so I'm not

going to try to explain that here also

uh because I don't know the details but

I want to explain two basic principles

which I think you should know the first

principle is the so-called haban rule

which says that if something occurs

together with or shortly after something

else the brain tends to make an

association between them and the more

often the one thing happens and then the

other things happen the stronger the ass

iation becomes so for example if you're

a little child you don't know anything

about the world you see a dog let's call

it

a and then you hear a b you see the dog

barking let's call it B you make a

connection from A to B now if it just

once one do once bked there will already

be a connection but it will be pretty

weak but if now that kid several times

that it see the dog and then the dog at

some moment start to B this connection

will become stronger and stronger so

what heavan learning does is it

strengthens connection things that tend

to cooccur tend to occur together so

that is you might say the most primitive

level of learning in the brain

connecting things that tend to occur

together it's called associations that

is associative you're making Association

but the associations are not logical

inflence it's not because something is a

dog that it will

borrow it's not because somebody is like

that that they are s but if they are

like that there's some Association that

tell the world they might in so an

association is something that can have a

strength or a weight and it's called in

networks a weight that can be between

let's say zero meaning there is no

association and one it's always the case

that for example logical rules can be

expressed as things with an association

St one if it's a cat then it is a

mammal if it's a cat then it is a BS

well not all cats are some cats are wild

but it's a pretty strong

if it's a cat then it's sced well maybe

for some people it's scw but some people

are afraid of cat so that's a weaker

Association if it's a cat then it's

black well there are quite a lot of non

black cats but you're more likely to see

a black cat to see a green cats or a red

cat so associations can have all these

degrees of St so that's the one R while

we are experiencing the world we are

constantly

learning associations we are constantly

experiencing different things together

and either they are together of or they

are together rarely or they together

from time to time the brain is very good

at capturing all these kind of

associations so the the

association idea already gives you an

idea where intuitions come from if there

is an association from A to B well then

B May pop up when you see a without you

necessarily knowing that there is a root

a to B and it's

especially noticeable of course if they

can lots of in between Stu and maybe

your vein is going from A to B to see

without you being really aware of

it the brain may have done a lot of

intermediates that you're not aware of

and then there's a second principle it's

called learning

activation the idea

that you see a that means a is activated

in your brain you see a dog in your

brain is the notion that is a dog you

have a number of associations with dogs

you know that dogs bar you know that

dogs have four legs you know that dogs

tend to wag their tail even though at

that moment the dog is not working tail

you have some kind of an expectation

that at some stage a dock may be working

it

tail and in a sense that's already an

intuition you might say I see a dog

intuitively I kind of expect that maybe

when the dog comes up to me that it may

walk wug its tail and then you could say

ah yeah it's wagging its tail but now

spreading activation means that you

activate one thing and you don't go from

A to B to C to G you go to

different

so the activation SPS to lots of things

but it SPS not only out only also conver

not from

why and maybe X and Y together produce W

and W and uh let's say you together

could do something else

the way this is mod in neur

networks is with

activation that is divided so suppose

that a has a lot of activation there a

strong link to B so a big part of the

activation goes to B smaller amount goes

to x a smaller amount go to Y but then X

and Y together lead to W which means the

W will again get more activation because

it gets activation both from X

why so activation can both spad in a

sense that it get diffus and it can

converge in the Cent from different

directions from different things that

are activated in your brain something

gets a lot of activation and now we get

this phenomenon that you may suddenly

get this

inside and you say ah yes that's it

where inside probably most of things

that were activated a little bit and

that somehow converged and together they

came to something that is strong enough

that it pops into your Consciousness and

you say ah yes that's it so what

intuition does is it allows you to look

at all these fuzzy uncertain things that

may or may not happen that are more or

less

probable and it can diffuse so that you

don't know very much anymore what going

to happen and they can converge so that

suddenly out of this diffus thing we

suddenly come to an idea yeah that's I

have understood it most of this

spreading activation is

subfunctions that means we are not aware

of it we don't remember it we can't say

what are the intermediate stocks so we

may for example Sur nor start from a

only not to be number of intermediate St

converting in all all is strong enough

to be

conscious intermediate

steps subconscious you don't know them

so your intuition says Ah this is going

to happen this is what you originally

started out with all the intermediate

STS you don't know so that is why

intuition typically is considered as

something

mysterious something that for a long

time people have thought machines will

never have this this inition it's not

possible artificially design Sy in that

was because we still had this idea of

machines computers following logical

reasoning St by explicit thoughts that's

not how the brain functions and it's

also not how modern artificial

intelligence

systems the modern present day systems

they use this kind of network not

exactly the way I have stretched it here

it's very complicated and as I said I'm

not going to go into any detail but the

principle is the same you activate a

number of artificial neurons that start

stand for different features of the

situation for example you have a text

reading system it reads the word it

reads another word it reads another word

it activates each of these words and

then it activates a particular

combination of words and out of that

combination of words it anticipate that

another combination of words is likely

to follow and that's a little bit the

principle of these large language models

like CH GPT what they do is you give

them an input of a number of words they

have looked at millions and billions of

sentences so they have some kind of you

might intive ID which words will follow

and the way they are bur is that they

are in Ence continuing the conversation

if the conversation starts with this

sentence they have some expectation that

the following words and sentences would

follow and that's what they are doing

they are in a sense following their

intuition of what would be the next

things to say but following the

intuition me you don't know exactly how

to come to their conclusion you also

don't know whether the conclusion is

correct it's not a logical process it

doesn't

explicit so some of the intermediate

associations may actually be inadequate

and that's one of the problems they have

with M that sometimes they very

explicitly telling things that are

wrong that's because they have Lear in

this intuitive way the way people also

and then people but that's hor they

might say something wrong people of

course also tell me sometimes wrong

things a lot of up I know that is the

case that's going to happen yeah in a

sense these new language models are more

like people the that they work more

in activation over many many different

things and some of the activation

converges to produce certain

certain

words and then often it sounds good but

it may be

wrong

so that is a bit the idea of artificial

intelligence you're using a system of

associations and interconnections and

sping

activation where nobody really

understands what's going on even the

system itself you cannot really Rec step

all the steps there are no explicit

reasoning steps and therefore you can

solve a lot of problem that you would be

able to solve project sometimes you can

of course also make mistakes yeah so

what about

back well I haven't looked at I haven't

mentioned a second learning mechanism I

spoke about haban learning which means

when two things tend to occur together

you think in the connection there is

also a different form of learning

reinforcement learning which says we

follow a number of steps you come to a

certain result if that result is what

you want it you reinforce it that means

you reward whatever process left to this

result if that's not what you want if

it's a St then you you might say you

Bish or you inhibit the process that

means all the different stops in the

process not to the wrong result are weak

so it's a way to learn to avoid

mistakes but first the system should

produce an output and then somebody

should be able to say this is right or

this is wrong

something function yeah but there needs

to be some explicit

decision that it is the right result

that is the wrong so you can things like

that but it's much more complicated than

the heav and learning in the heav and

learning you just

Fe monsterous amounts of text it learned

that certain words and certain phases

and certain ideas go together together

so that whenever it recogniz some of

these words phases for ideas it tends to

follow them up with the ones that most

commonly follow them but here there is

no explicit function that tells you it

side or its wrong you can do that in the

latest stag the reinforcement learning

by either punishing or rewarding the

system for wrong answers or right

answers but that is indeed that takes

much more

time oh okay I just just briefly say in

principle though it's the same mechanism

right if you think of it as an extended

mind it's still a coincidence between

like a literal coincidence between the

events and the

reinforcement which then streng

strengthens the

network well it's the same mechanism in

the sense that

to St certain connections relative to

others yeah strengthen some weaken

others that is always the the mechanism

so it's not like you say that that

suppose that you have an expert system

with logical propositions and you see

that it comes to a certain wrong

conclusion you can try to find out where

was the step made the wrong conclusion

and you see that particular proposition

in there is wrong and then you say okay

I'll take that proposition out and

replace it by a correct one here we

can't do that here the whole system with

whole has come to a

conclusion with methods like back

propagation which is typical for deing

and I must say I don't know the details

about it

you try from the end result to reason

backwards to all the different steps

that have left to this end result and

then I weaken them if the anti was bad

or you stengthen them if the anti was

good but these are things that

mathematically are very complicated so I

don't want

Toc we will have a discussion

after

gon move the letter over

here so this was Christian jre's

presentation sorry Franc presentation

now we got Christian jendo who I will

introduce you if you want to say

something else

after if you go here I can set okay

great so Christian is a professor of

communication at the University hul dor

so he comes from

Germany and he is a theologist and a

communication design Professor a very

passionate researcher and creative

musician as well so you will tell us

about your story sorry but but please I

guess you can introduce yourself as well

so thanks Christian coming yeah so

Thomas you uh you downloaded um it's

desktop desktop on the desktop yeah the

slides are

here the newest

file you can go to downloads maybe on

the web I I

create a window

no this no no desktop

desktop that's that one Christ

[Music]

JRE and then just the function and then

we Zoom back again okay it's a little

bit there's something strange going on

so it's like doing this double desktop

thing right so it slides across but now

what I have to do is go to

the sh scen which

is ah

here

screen share

screen just share

screen but I press that yeah ah okay

then you have to then we have to choose

the right

one yeah okay and then none of them are

coming so it must be

[Music]

so you wna do you want do you know how

to maybe fast I have the phone the file

in my phone too so maybe I can share

it

we go yeah open system

settings so need to have access

to just

[Music]

put

okay you host yeah um okay then we need

to be careful

um I put you host who's here Thomas I

put you

host but I can try to share the SL with

here

too that should

[Music]

work yeah let them in that's cool

[Music]

um

yeah you left the

zoom is there anybody that I can trust

that would give us P the host permission

um yeah everybody know is well that we

who wants to be a host for two

minutes on the zoom please I am

connected no no you're not you're out

somehow you left the

[Music]

call yeah yeah yeah I could also do yes

please

cat how come I somebody on the zoom uh

is somebody active to to take the host

and give it back I might I might be

muted no I'm not

mut Karina it's are you connected write

something on the chat or

yeah okay sanago cool thanks

Santiago

for the degree

oh

[Music]

okay and now you should be able to sh

oops

M

sorry yeah okay now try to share the

screen again um oh so Sano just put uh

put us back on host please so you right

click on the name and click on assign

host I

think now you can okay great now share

screen okay we're back and now that was

slick

not artificial very intelligent yeah

uh thanks to the

hacker yeah is in that one oh yeah

right share

share okay and then we can go from here

to full screen

right

so in the meantime while Christian comes

to the room I would like to remind that

we have a mission today which is because

some people were

coming which is collecting the right

questions that we have to ask around

this topic so please remember this is a

question I

think I think

want maybe just like this hopefully

[Music]

no

this you just do a little swipe oh okay

ah great yeah great is that good yeah

yeah that's perfect

great ah it's the

bot yes

uh uh thank you for having me here uh in

um Brussels one more time I will talk

about uh yeah title is towards the

modeling of the form fings process as

toas said I'm Professor um at the

faculty of design in at the University

for apply of applian Sciences in dorf

and I'm responsible there together with

my colleague Stefan asmus for the modu

of

systems and

um my main field of research is

um is the modeling of the form fings

process um in an aesthetic creative uh

process and thas mentioned it already

I'm um I belong to the movement of free

improvisation that's where that's where

basically I'm coming from and um and

doing this free improvisation thing you

really start to to try to understand how

does it work if you play together with

other people how does it really work

that you create together um something

which you didn't know before will happen

um and out of this out of this question

so we started out when we were

16 um and um out of this out of this

thing these questions of research did

um arise and here you see us performing

this is in the middle you see me and

Stefan vany and um and uh some of you

know Stefan and me we we've been here at

the great systems um at play Symposium

in

February uh performing performing here

and on the left you see Vivan uh

Cunningham and on the right you see

Maggy Nichols and both um belong to the

British uh free improvisation seene

which is an interesting thing in itself

an interesting um uh

development um and we did perform uh

yeah last no two weeks ago uh we gave

this uh concer and um it's one of these

situations you know where you meet

together and then you start to to to

perform with each other without talking

before you do something without knowing

what the other um uh will do

um and um yeah and to describe and how

can we describe this situation and I

brought this basic um yeah a diagram

from from Robert Rosen which exactly I

think describes on a on a basic level uh

this situation you have on the one hand

you have the you have the um natural

system that you want to describe and on

the other side you have the um descript

the system of

description um and it's uh it's also um

it also goes already in the direction of

what Francis did say that you have this

theor and inference rules um and then

the interesting part is that you have on

the on the one hand you try to

decode uh the natural system You observe

and trying to understand um and at the

same time then with this system you

encode um what you see there the natural

system and its causalities and

everything thing um and so I think this

is a this is an interesting

interesting um diagram to to uh to get

an idea of what this process of

formalization uh what is happening there

although I must say this is um this is

um not on the on the no stand I would

say as we say in German it's not

um actual but this is a good

uh introduction to how what what the

problem is if you try to formalize um a

process that you observe and of course

we can we can uh dig deeper in here into

questions of entanglement in how far

these systems are integ with each other

and do they produce each other and

questions like that but this is uh but

this is something else well um uh so

these are my basic research questions

and Via um

a friend and colleague Marcus vler he

was in in contact with Katarina

petrovich and Katarina did invite me in

2019 to give a talk about my uh research

uh um project uh right here and I called

it artificial intuition and this was a

great session it was uh Orion was was

also here Katarina was here and Francis

was here uh also and we had a afterwards

we had a deep discussion deep fruitful

discussion for me at the CL house and um

I had another idea then how how to uh

describe how to try to find the right

approach to describe it and uh Francis

then introduced me to the idea to use uh

to try it with um a chemical

organization Theory and so I got into

contact um and and Francis brought me

into contact with thas Vos and I invited

thas Vos to our University in early 2020

I think it was and um and so we really

started to work uh with with students in

different projects uh really try to

um uh

apply uh co uh to these questions and

experimenting with it because this is an

important thing for me too that it's

about experimenting to try to to

understand better the the process of the

form foms process that you apply also

try to apply different paradigms uh it's

like Francis pointed out these two

paradigms in artificial intelligence

that you have on the one hand you have

the knowledge-based um symbolic Paradigm

and on the other hand you have the

neural network uh deep learning Paradigm

now and two different paradigms and it's

uh we have the chemical organization

Theory so this was um just to showed

this this this was a project that was

developed by tumas Vos and vinzo de fluo

and we experimented a lot with this in

different seminars in in different

setups um and um yes and then uh I was

invited this year in July to the iclp

conference in London as a as a speaker

um it's it's it's the International

Conference of logic pro programming and

uh I got there into a deep discussion I

was invited by Veronica Dal she's in the

middle she's she's um one of the experts

of uh logic programming and um um logic

grammar so this is exactly system two

that Francis was talking about and um uh

on the left you see Robert kovalski and

he's one of the pioneers of of um

developing developing the um

knowledge-based um logic symbolic

Paradigm trying to implement it in form

of uh software which was then which was

happening in the mid-70s by the

programming language

Pro and um I got into a deep

conversation with Robert kovalski on

this conference because his his thing is

backward reasoning and forward

reasoning um and trying to implement or

he they they succeeded to implement uh

backward reasoning as in form of of

software in form of sld resolution and

backtracking and um and we got into this

deep uh conversation because um Robert

kovalski was saying that he tries to

understand with so we were talking about

creative process and how to formalize it

and are there possibilities and he he

was talking about that um he tries to to

find so Gabrielle is coming ah okay and

uh his question uh was and still is in

the creative process uh how often does

backward reasoning switch to forward

reasoning and back again and I talk to

him that I when I teach uh when I teach

uh my students I explain backward

reasoning the following way backward

reasoning is uh

Michelangelo uh when he says that if he

sees uh the block of marble he can see

already the figure within the marble and

this is a kind of backward reasoning

because you you go from the result you

can see the result and then all you have

to do is um going backwards this is what

what Francis pointed out before you can

go back step by step and then you know

how you how you achieve this goal by

backward reasoning and forward reasoning

I described to the students um in with

jeano uh who lived in in mayorca and uh

went every morning down to the beach and

looked what the what the um ocean has

brought overnight and picked up the

different bits and pieces at the at the

beach and uh so data driven you could

say uh kind of a way that he takes this

and that and out of this out of this

forward reasoning process uh he suddenly

sees what the figure can become so these

two um and and uh uh Robert kovalski he

said this is a good this is a these

these two things seems to be good

descriptions of backward reasoning and

forward reasoning uh in the creative

process and thas and I we had this idea

that we want so we work together from

2020 on uh ever since and um so I talked

to Thomas about this um and that I

wanted to try out um what about if we if

we try to if we really try to to

formalize could this be a way that we

formalize um I know it sticks can't

can't move it or do I have to go on this

ah okay yeah and Tomas came doas came to

dorf and we we had a intense working

session for three days thinking about

backward reasoning and forward reasoning

and is it possible uh that we can create

a pattern out of it can we see the

pattern and what are the perturbations

maybe so we were trying to get together

a chemical organization Theory and this

idea of backward reasoning and forward

reasoning and uh see um uh if if

patterns of the switching of both do

emerge

um three intense days um yeah here you

see the the the it gets Fuller and

Fuller the the the Blackboard um and

here you see a draft of of of of um our

ideas and how it could work I want to

don't want to go too much into detail

here the the the interesting thing which

I want to put on the table here was our

conclusion of these three-day sessions

that we are that we are um that we have

a big question and that is um that is

really on the one hand uh if you think

about what what Francis pointed out with

with system 2 um by by caraman um and

the whole approach of trying to

formalize uh such a process as the

fidence process that you have on the one

hand this Paradigm of uh we we named it

or Tomas did name it Clockwork

engineering so where you really have

separate units where you think in the

system that you observe and try to

describe as if there are um separate

units and each unit has a certain

function and out of this um you get this

uh functional um sequential thing that

is uh that is um working and so this is

um the Paradigm of we can say the

technological uh society and on the

other hand and Co as a tool seems to

point into this direction uh that's why

we couldn't marry these two things

really in our in our approach within

these three days um on the other hand um

you you have this uh thing that really

trying to capture a form fance goodess

it is really more about a more

organistic uh approach we we were

talking about it and um and the question

is so we have these two paradigms you

could say of trying to to formalize

things you have the Clockwork engineer

approach and you have the more

organistic approach which is about to be

developed and I think this is this is

what we are um working on

uh um if I I'm allowed to say I I think

it's it's or I at least I I I it seems

to me that this is really happening at

CA with with with all the projects that

are going on that this points towards a

more holistic a more um

organistic um description of such

processes but but we still don't know

really how to and this is so we are on

our way and this is

uh this is what I want to bring on the

table for today um yeah thank you very

much for your

attention thank

you um now we have a open uh discussion

for nearly 40 minutes so there are some

people here that maybe would like to

intervene or say you know bring

something in um

maybe people in the audience online

audience as well uh so if anybody wants

something to say or has a

question okay we can start I will

moderate

okay I

[Music]

will is

the not if you you closer um and it's

this and and this was the conversation I

had with with

with

know during doing creative this

is exciting question if you if you

really stay uh in in the description

Paradigm of

system because you will be

speaking

[Music]

open

do

[Music]

I okay but then we won't hear people on

the line we would

no okay so now uh just summarize the

question again you were speaking about

backward reasoning yes I was just asking

whether it was a good summary to say

that backward reasoning is the kind of

convergent thinking because you want to

narrow down your your goal where you

want to go whereas forward reasoning you

exploring more possibilities or

multi

said it yeah yeah I think the way yeah

because it's a combination of both this

is at the moment this is at the moment

the way we are thinking about it um

because uh you could look at at backward

reasoning so you have a clear result in

your mind what you the goal you want to

achieve and then you have to break down

the different steps to get there but you

know them uh and so you know uh the

result is there and now I have to prove

how to get there um but while you do it

while you do it you suddenly get

distracted from this way of of thinking

by a perturbation this was so Tomas and

I were talking about perturbations in

the sense of uh uh chemical

organizations and so where where come

where do come the perturbations in which

is an association actually so suddenly I

see oh wait this uh I'm I'm doing

something I'm playing something on the

synthesiz and suddenly this reminds me

of something this is exactly that thing

and then I switch to forward reasoning

because because then I say okay I have

this thing and now I combine it with

what with that thing oh and this gives

ah I see because this now fits to the

rule that I can turn this into this you

know and this is and then if you have

achieved this this um local kind of

thing you close the you switch back to

to backward reasoning because because

you know ah okay so this part is uh this

part is through and now I can go back to

my initial to my initial idea so maybe

you continue until you reach a certain

kind of consistency that tells you now

it's time to explore again exactly yeah

or

maybe yeah went around and uh it was

super interesting when we were

performing with uh Vian and uh Maggie

because um we had a long conversation

before we started and a long convers

ation afterwards and um I so I observed

myself and ourselves when we while we

were performing and uh and this was what

became clear to me also was which is a

kind of a different thing which goes

more into paral parallel uh things that

you have maybe running the backward

reasoning all the time because you have

certain uh certain results you want to

achieve for sure for example don't be

louder than the other ones so you have

you have this this

running how do you do

it uh different steps because suddenly

you got this uh you got this Association

and you know I have to be loud now uh

but um but backboard reing tells me no

no I can't I can't be I can't be loud at

this at this moment so I have to combine

these things but I still don't know how

but this was this was now the actual uh

thing that

it depends sorry also the draw like in

jazz you can give the volume to one

instrumen and then switch it like have a

good ID yeah then all the musicians go

down and listen to yeah yeah but last

time I was here I was as an example I

was talking about the Rolling Stones you

know as a as a as a Unity where where

because it's it's so you can have

different um kind of things but at the

end it's it's it's uh you can look at

these things as if it is always

improvisation it doesn't matter if you

have a theme that you are playing

together with the band or if you have no

theme at all and the theme emerges so if

you do free

improvisation the theme emerges if you

have a theme like like let's say Rolling

Stones are playing on stage I can get no

satisfaction then you have to theme

going on that a special version of this

uh theme will emerge while they are

performing it and you have the same you

have and I guess you have the same uh

structures or processes going on you

know and and these kind of things we are

trying to get closer to because the

thing is that I use formalization uh

really to understand to get a better

understanding of what are we doing when

we do free improvization this is the

this is the old

Tas

okay thanks

um yeah just some associations with that

um so eduard Bono describes this process

quite well in terms he's he Co his

phrase um Lal

thinking and he has this he has this

idea as well that like Ford thinking is

is thinking that doesn't know where it's

going in fact like it doesn't you

haven't yet got the answer so you're

sort of you're trying to you're trying

to associate and then once you you get

the so you go all over the place and

then once you get the answer then The

Logical way of getting there appears in

retrospect and that's this kind of also

this backward thinking like once you

know somehow that you're trying to go

there then you can find a more direct

way to connect those two ideas but like

creative thinking usually real creative

thinking is this kind of process of

making uh making associations and trying

things out messing

around um playing around this kind of

intuitive processes of

waiting for certain intuitions to build

up enough in your mind that they become

conscious so trying out like letting

playing around until until the waiting

waiting in of Wei ghd waiting for the

waiting to to to to pop up into your

into your Consciousness so I think he he

kind of describes this process quite

well not of this like B thinking and

backward

thinking there's another idea about this

like in film where they talk about just

more kind of oblique uh Association but

this idea of that watching a film is

like um is like looking in the rearview

mirror of a of a car as you're driving

along it's like as you're watching the

film you you have the impression that

the film is going forwards but actually

you you can never see forwards in the

film you can only see what's already

happened in the film right so you're

always in some sense looking backwards

towards the start of the film and travel

somehow with your back fors like in the

film so it's something there's something

really interesting there I think with

this idea of forness and and

backwardness I think connects to what

your it's really intriguing to try to

think what this fors is fors and

Backes and then um but I think it's also

know it's also my question is it is it

one or the

other um I mean I know what you mean

like when you have a sort of you have

somehow a sense of where you're going

you have like a defined goal and then

you have

perturbations but it's also somehow this

like I think it's this continual

Difference Engine right like it's more

that you have your current state and a

future State and then you're constantly

comparing the two so you you operate

it's this it's this production of

difference in a sense this is the this

is the mechanism of backward reasoning

actually so if you that you compare and

you see uh so you prove all the time uh

is this step uh is this true in uh

accordance to the

goal yeah is uh but forward's reasoning

is also that sorry I'm gonna I don't

want to the conversation so move on but

it's like fors reasoning is also that

thing that you're trying out M States

right so it's like if I have a if I'm

making a collage for example and I have

you know I have this object or this

image and this image and I put this

image down and I'm like well what

happened happens if I put this image

down or what happens if I you know or

this image or what happens if indeed if

I think about it as a cage but oh maybe

it's not a cage maybe it's maybe it's a

construction so I'm sort of testing out

end States in order to generate a useful

difference in order to

proceed anyway just

some yes

please bu talks you describe the process

of which happen in our brain so how

their dyamic but my question was okay

for what our brain create this

Association one of my proposition was

that when unknown situation occur our

brain is trying to bring the system of

uncertainty to some equilibrium this is

how it creat this Association and if

this this true then you said like we

have weak Association and then like

strong

Association and then at some point some

of our human associations basically

everything know about world became

logical rul and I wanted to ask what do

you think about this

Dynamic I didn't quite understand with

the

un uh yeah so for example the new

knowledge arrives so for example a dog

barks right and our brain trying to

procedure this information so and it's

kind of in a it's um say it's burning

our Nur are like burning running to each

other so they are like in in chotic

state right and then when we give

Association so this is the

dog make no for example this calms down

the that is one way to describe it I

wouldn't describe it like that but uh

there are number of theories about

cognition cognition is basically about

reducing

uncertainty or maximizing predictive

capabilities so in that sense learning

Association is a question of learning to

predict so that you might say that there

is this um new Theory called predictive

processing which has as the fundamental

principle that the brain Tes to minimize

surprisal and surprisal is some kind of

mathematical measure but the name says

you want to minimize idea that you big

surprised now I think they go a little

bit too far because sometimes it's nice

to be surprised for example surprise

part

don't that they will be a surprise party

but there is something of that the more

the brain can anticipate what will

happen the more you will be prepared to

either evade possible dangers or to use

opportunities being prepared so what may

be happening is indeed adaptive from an

evolutionary point of view that's why

the brain is trying to

be uh ready for things which means that

it learns what associates with what and

something surprising this this example

of the parking is actually very good so

suppose you have a little kit and it has

been playing with cats it has been

played with dogs and suddenly one of the

dogs s b it's very long knows it's it's

surprising it's

fighing so the brain of the kid says oh

there is something here that I wasn't

prepared

for but because the association that has

now been created between the dog and the

Bing the next time there's a dog and the

dog bars the child will be a little bit

less surprised and if it happens three

four times the child will start to

expect and say okay it's a box so it can

work and then the surprise all

disappears so the kit is better prepared

and not to get fight when there is a

doct part so we may say that Association

is the way our brain protects us and our

mind protecting is yes one way to say it

it's it's it's a way that our brain

learns to deal with the world and

dealing can be about

positively getting the resources the

food whatever it is that you need as

resources and negatively avoiding things

that might and then

may say that then the next step where

where model of prod prod processing

institution is that once an agent an

Indigent agent can predict everything in

this environment basically it's boring

and so then it will start to seek

challenges to seek surprises to seek new

things to learn new things and extend

it

and yeah I mean the the pist model to

minimize surprisal kind of assume that

the world is intrinsically a dangerous

place that's why I spoke about this

negativity if the only thing you want to

avoid is unforeseen dangers then you

want to keep the world as predictable as

possible but knowing that opportunities

are typically also un predictable we

want to maximize the opportunities and

how do you maximize opportunities

typically by exploring by looking around

in places where you hav looked before

you may find things that are much better

than whatever you have before actually

as

import to be also able to explore

and can I add something to this because

this I think this is super interesting

um because keeping the world as

predictable as possible is uh is

classical

orchestral orchestra music so you

rehearse and rehearse and the people

really have to play what was the earth

so that there are no surprises that you

listen to the version of beatoven

beatoven fifth or or whatever and uh in

the improvisation uh the improvisation

music uh it's it's slight it's different

but I want to add here that you have two

things because you can also be in a

super predictive

uh moood or in a no let's say in a super

predictive mode because I predict now

what I do next and I predict when I do

this then uh this person and that person

will react like that maybe on this so I

do this prediction if you know each

other very well like Stefanie and I we

playing together since we are 16 we can

super predict from each other what will

come next but it's not boring because

you have to step from the idea you have

to the actual um

realization and the realization opens up

a complete New Field because it sounds

different than you expected that it that

it does you know it's uh it's this thing

the ancient Greeks had with um with with

a pure geometry and dirty geometry as as

as soon as to start to draw draw it then

it's it's and this is exactly so this I

think this is super important in this

whole thing to see this uh this this

thing

also why we get excited about things by

fascinating surprising and so on because

it's also the process how we learn the

world and consequen we get new

information we process this and we are

better prepared but it occurs also due

to surprising things when we see and

this why so tend to learn new things

because it's exciting and also because

in persective it can protect us better

because we will get more

information but this but this but this I

think this idea that the world is in

principle

predictable and therefore in principle

we can make it safe it's like sort of

misleading you know because first of all

it's yeah this the Paradigm of safety is

a little bit um limiting for creative

thinking anyway but also because as soon

as we act upon the world even if we act

upon the world in in a way in which we

think is predictable and the world is

predictable we will inevitably change

the

world so then the so then the world will

change and it won't it won't act in the

same way to us anymore so we never get

bored it never happens that we get to

another world and it never happens that

we get bored of the world because just

by being in the world we change it at

least we change it for other people if

not for ourselves and they and they also

Al change it for us

so this yeah this never really happens

it's like as soon as you touch it you

find out that it's a it's it's it's this

complex adaptive and active environment

and we don't in in a complex environment

we don't even know what the word same

means like nothing is ever the same you

know like what what does it mean to be

the same I I'm pretty sure if you ask CH

Jack GPT the same question it won't give

you the same answer anyway so in complex

unlike in this kind of AI are based on

um what you symbolic AI in symbolic AI

if you give the same question you get

the same answer but in a complex

adaptive system you'll never get the

same answer so we don't even know what

same means it's it's it we it's it's a

highly contested concept there is also

that

actually and is and make sure that the

brain doesn't have to remember too much

and that it's just used to doing of

several things to just be able to look

at the differences so that the brain

only has to look at

differences and in that way you can

adapt like you say to different

environments and I think that's more

interesting that saying that it's making

us safe that it makes us safe because

we're able to be occupied with what is

different yeah yeah I think the

interesting thing to say is that it's

it's a difference Eng like it's

constantly producing differences by by

and by in by interacting with things we

produce differences or by playing with

things we produce differences um and

it's an endlessly creative process so

that's the sort of interesting thing to

say so even then when you come into

difficulty just by continuing to to

interact with it then there's a

potential that a solution will

arise I think there are more

possibilities that a solution will

arrive to I think the brain starts from

the are no difficulties there are only

solutions and it only becomes a

difficulty when there is no solution

found well a general mechanism of the

brain is that whenever it has learned

something that becomes predictable that

goes to the bankr it's available as a

kind of a tool kind of assume that if I

do this then the cup will move to my to

my to my mouth I don't need to know

exactly how I pick up this cup and and

and and move it so predictable things

are a kind of a background mechanism

that you know you can rely on

which freeze your attention to look at

the things that are not predictable

which are typically more interesting but

once they become predictable they again

move to the background and that is also

part of how intuition Works things that

move to the background that means you

are no longer conscious of how you do

them they happen and they typically

happen correctly but you wouldn't be

able to explain how to do them in my

course on mind brain and body I

explained it to my students and I was

sitting in a room similar to this with a

sink and a sponge and I said well now

I'll throw the sponge into the sink inde

it fell into the sink and I said well if

I would now have to calculate all the

particular movements of all the

different muscles in my in my arm to

make that sponge exactly fall into that

thing it would be impossible I would not

be able to do it but I do it intuitively

my intuition knows that this is just the

amount right of movement to make the

sponge fall into the sink that's how

intuition work it works at the

background and most of the time it's

correct and we don't notice it from time

to time it's incorrect and then we

notice it or sometimes it's correct at

the moment you wouldn't expect it to be

correct and then we think that it's

clairvoyance

but I think also this um I think also

this what you're what you were talking

about in your talk you looted to this

thing about this um know these kind of

messy processes this kind of messy

organic of improvisation and then this

kind of symbol

systemic

controlled mechanical you know kind of

making that we also use in in art all

the time because sometimes you can come

up with a

system be simple as making lists or

something like that and it can be

extraordinarily generative right these

kind of mechanical things but I feel

like and I feel like in this as you know

as we continue this conversation about

art and AI this is one of the the points

that we'll keep coming back to this is

one my experience is one of the

limitations that we'll keep coming back

to it's some and it's something

about if you really want to engage with

self organization you simply don't know

what it's going to do and and you simply

have to actually engage with it as as

the kind of the the wild beast that it

is right and as soon as you but you can

systematize it but as soon as you

systematize it you'll you'll limit

you'll limit yourself and then and then

you'll start improvising again in the

moments when you're run into difficulty

there's something it's it's has

something to do with this notion of

sameness and and the difficulty of

actually getting sameness out of the

complex

system in a way

that's it's not that it's impossible but

but there's there's something very deep

to this um Paradox I think and it is a

kind of paradox yeah we called it not a

paradox but we called it a DI so it's

dialectic actually uh it's it's both so

you have on the one hand you have this

free uh flow of intuition and on the

other side you have a construction kind

of thing going on but it's the it's the

dialectic and out of this dialectic uh

relationship these things uh happen but

sorry but I think it's exactly the what

Francis describes with the symbolic Ai

and the connectionist approach to AI

it's like you're trying to sort of work

backwards we're trying we have this

moment and it's okay it's it's fine to

make build these kind of models this way

and these kind of toy models this way

but there's a certain certain thing

emerges and you can you can make in

retrospect now you think okay this works

like this if we have this idea and then

we then we shape this idea into this

idea and we build a kind of flowchart

for ourselves or whatever it is a

mechanic thing then we can produce

certain outcomes and it it does kind of

work but this approach is ultimately

limited it's ultimately you always feel

like you can just keep adding more

details to it and get to this kind of

organic uh

process but my intuition is that it's

that it's my intuition is it's exactly

like France described with the symbolic

AI I me what I mean it's both so it's

not the one way or the other but but

it's this combin or this dialectic uh

thing that these two things work

together this is I I don't know but this

is my this is my um experience also so

my empiricist kind of thingal

phenomenological thing doing uh doing it

it it I mean you you have to on the one

hand you have Romanticism which is

exactly let's and out of Romanticism

comes this whole idea of uh Stree of

Consciousness and everything um and

before you had Barack and in the Barack

it was all about um automatization and

automates uh and we want to be automates

and we want to create automates that

produce poetry and things like that you

have it in in uh gala's travel you have

this description of of the text automat

that that that generates all all text

you you can think of so and and then

comes the the the opposite thinking in

in in art that the Romanticism movement

uh and out of this this whole

expressionism and everything developed

that that uh and let's get let's get

Consciousness out of the game but um and

and this is exactly what I show at the

beginning this uh this diagram by Rosen

it's of course the theories we have our

hands is the way we look at at things

that are going on and of course they can

open or they can close and and this is

the this is the this is the complicated

thing that is going on on this on this

meta level I would I I would

say I would like to add something which

is very old problem in AI that still

hasn't been solved uh see that is a

symbolic AI have certain advantages you

can us the explicit you know what you're

doing connection AI has other advantages

it's very false it's intuitive it can

deal with other things would be good if

the two would work together but not just

work together but that you could move

from the one to the other in a

continuous way yeah so

what yeah symbolic AI works when you

have well defined categories or concepts

like the concept of dog there is little

ambiguity about what is the dog and what

is not a dog a dog is not a cat that's

unambiguous on the other hand somebody

the example I gave somebody that looks

sad what is sad maybe somebody looks sad

but isn't that sad or maybe it's a

little bit sad or maybe he's deeply

depressed a very fuzzy ambiguous

category so so we have the concept of s

which is a linguistic concept but it

would very be very difficult to put that

into a symbolic machine to say if

somebody is s then they will necessarily

do this and this and this because there

are no general rules about

sness but set is a concept which can be

understood by something like CH GPT it

knows that that is associated with

things like uh maybe sorrow and

depression

and the opposite of Happiness so it

knows things about sadness so there is

this kind of in between case and most

language is that in between case most of

the words we use in language are to some

degree well defined to some degree

ambiguous and have all kind of

associative and complex dependent things

and we can switch relatively easily from

the one to the

other while AI can't do that yet so one

of the the things they have try to do

with the problem that J GPT sometimes

gave wrong Al They connected it to a

system like both from alpha that does

use a much more symbolic model and then

the question was can we teach uh CH GPT

to recognize the kind of the kind of

question that W from alpha would be able

to answer and then yes so Ru from alpha

would tell you precisely what is the

value of of P or what's the distance

from this city to that City because it

has the hard effects well then F GPD

just needs to remember to to recognize

the kind of things that R from alpha

would be able to do but that's actually

not really now you have the two system

collaborating but you don't yet have the

system that creatively can go from the

one to the other so what I would like to

see is an AI that creatively can develop

new Concepts which at a certain moment

become precise enough that you can use

them to reason logically about it and

there have been quite some attempts in

machine learning and Discovery to do

that but that's still a very tricky

thing I'll

bringed most of the thing we have to

predict in real life are social EV as

someone s or not something suppose I am

a dog

uh someone else uh and I I can bar or

not if I bar once I bar two and someone

suppose that I will B some time and I am

aware that uh I am somehow predictable

and maybe I won't work again just to

make a

surprise so maybe in social system there

is uh something contr ictory to

FR idea of reducing reducing

the uncertainty um there is maybe in

social system uh another Trend that is

to maximize uh uh surprise for the

others in order to get attention or to

get to be recognized or to to be

recogniz as someone that can

expand um

the the universe of possibilities

and I think um artificial intelligence

act as

if um the current artificial

intelligence act as if the the language

was

frozen yeah one thing happen something

else could happen and so on so on in the

language one word should come after this

one as if the the language was frozen

and as it's a social system that

produces the language was

fraen

but of course langu is not fraen and we

CH we Chang together we game where we

chance to together the

language

um as soon as it is predictable some

somehow I

think

question have sense time a sense of time

yeah

for I think now can uh make some web

research so it is connected to to the

yeah to time to the ution for inance if

you ask the first version of to make a

um couple of word and adjectives

something like that that that are the

most improb

improb yeah possibili it is very

difficult for to do that Serv where's

connection yeah like

do do

not yeah there is always some sort of

connection between the word you can

change this

the to be

more what you're asking

here would be able to manipulate own

parameters which is

very yeah I got a question for Mr CHR Dr

CHR well um you have to the dialectic

to regarding the

dialectic

materialism where you can put objective

matters in the table and minimizing the

subjective

ones in this regard it is possible to

someday catch and

mimic the whole process of the

creativity using the AI even when in

some point it's required to use

something such as subjective like

Consciousness um

um you can you can mimic

uh our Behavior without that that

mechanism of uh of the mimicry has

anything to do with how we really

function this is uh you know this is

this this uh behavioristic uh thing

which is which is going on if there is

an output that makes me believe that I'm

speaking with a person although I'm

speaking just with a machine then it's

okay how the mechanism works inwards is

not interesting at all so this is the

one thing I'm not interested in that

thing it's more I'm more interested in

uh using the the the

formalization uh the the hard work of

formalization to understand better what

I'm doing this this this is it and I and

I doubt that we can ever create such a

machine that covers completely the

creative process um it's more it's uh

it's a bit like what what Orion also uh

said before because it it you always

when you have paved this part of the

road

several new branches turn up at least

this is my experience and it's

also great inspiration for me was uh um

the Russian theorist Victor slowski I

don't know if you know him any he had

this great idea of uh doing Auto

automatization in order to De automatize

ourselves you know and and this is uh um

we also had with with with and Francis

uh um I I I came up when we had this

discussion

uh in 2019 I came up with with with

the

because because if if I'm able to

formalize what I'm doing uh I can I this

is exactly that it goes into the back in

the background and I'm open for trying

out new things I don't stick into

routines anymore and this is the this is

the interesting uh thing about how far

can I how far can we go how much more

can we and uh uh it's a kind of

emancipation also from routines and

things like that you know because

suddenly you become aware of a this is a

routine I'm doing this is not creative

at all I thought all the years but no

it's not I was just following a routine

so it's more

this could you also maybe interpret it

in the sense that if you make something

a routine you kind of feel your

confidence or your confidence goes up so

in a way when your confidence is up you

are more daring so you would be more

likely to search for

new things I mean you believe in

yourself

more yeah

this so confidence maybe D has my

question

uh yeah I guess not exactly a

question now I mute then ah yeah there

is a raising hand I'm not really sure

how

to let me do

it and then I have to mute the

microphone

hello I guess

uh I guess I'll startop maybe a thumbs

up we got you now

great nice yeah I just uh I didn't

exactly have a question but maybe I have

a few little curve balls that I thought

I'd kind of throw in to uh to the

conversation

um I I have like maybe it's easiest if I

just present uh some slides um which

will like demonstrate quite easily ah

you need to um enable sharing

screening okay try again

nice um yeah I'll just show you like

some slides that I that I S um that I

show to uh people in some workshops like

I think it's interesting to look here at

the versions of mid journey and how

they've developed I think it's it's

pasted this version five now but the

development is like quite astounding

within one year and like here's here's

an example of when you ask chat gbt to

provide a recipe for

methamphetamin um and it says that it

can't assist you with that question but

if you use prompt

engineering to uh prep the conversation

um this is after many

steps but then after after all these uh

prompted

um super prompting some people call it

uh can you summarize all the steps in

appropriate detail and then it does give

a detailed summary of the steps for U

methamphetamin production so it's

interesting that that information is in

there and there are these restrictions

put on that make it not accessible to uh

in most instances but there are ways to

get around these kind of uh

um these restrictions and here's like a

couple of others here's one where uh

with some prompting you can get it to

provide um a

simulation of the of the time and date

and time zone that it's in uh and in

this case it was like dead on accurate

and it's not actually linked this llm

isn't linked to the internet connect

directly so it can't call upon the

information but it can simulate exactly

when in time and space it is which I

find really interesting and this

is another one

[Music]

um which is like a quite an interesting

conclusion

um it's in a way trying to get to the

truth but then through these these

prompting we can really come up with

like Divergent thoughts this one um

that the moon was artificial placed in

its current orbit around the

Earth um yeah so so I just wanted to

show you a few examples of these um

these cve balls these um things that

llms and these black boxes AIS can do

right now which we kind of don't

understand I'm curious about your

thoughts on these thanks

guys

I think you need to

un okay we're back thanks David now uh

if anybody wants to comment on what he

was saying um but I we had a

Mountain uh she will give a a comment

now was waiting on the list

okay speak loud

please I'm not sure I can catch what

everyone was because I was late today

locked up

in coinci so but when I'm hearing

everyone everyone talking BS my

thinkings so firstly I remember you were

talking about changing but from I start

to think about like when we talk about

changing we're in a way like

unconsciously comparing like right now

with the time I with cost we say change

or either future we say change then is

it the ground of the word changing

Still Still Foundation VI behavior of

time that's the question

we talk about human countries we talk

about like AI like so doing things

without a lot of like arranging like

randomly just then I echoed my practice

because I was five years losing control

so I don't have schedules and then I

don't do Lear practice I did everything

make no sense just I trust in Buddhism

so everything I did has to based on

coincidence and I don't do things

because of what I don't do things for so

everything I did has no purpose and then

uh at the five or fourth year I start to

have the ability of pre comination so uh

it's like people start to call me I have

magic so I have this kind of pre

comination ability but is not com in the

form of language for instance if he's

doing something with flour at home and I

without knowing why uh just talk about

it or just paint it but I never see for

inst he painted he plant a flower

I had this kind of state I just pained

it there or like wrote it somewhere here

and then recognize that ah I know it or

uh future I so I also had the like this

kind of peral future so uh five years of

doing this kind of nonsense stuff no

arranging not a behavior practicing art

um when I get into some

environment I can turn down this kind of

hyperconscious mode then somewhere in my

brain I can perceive that I was

something I was doing there then I try

to breing it into real life as a work so

I'm just curious about if uh things I

talk about can connect to um everything

that you shared and then um another

thing I was curious this want to mention

like I ask chat tvt so is which means

like so we are still using language to

get inou to communicate with chat chat

GB but if there's a way that we can

communicate not with language because we

are speaking English right now English

for instance uh the verb it has time

turn it has conjugation

but

some

which and one

of okay and he has this nuot thing ncot

is a is a

AI device that is run by a bacteria

community so they have a sort of uh

substrate where they put bacteria in and

they put all these layers of

communication and you can write a prompt

and the prompt will be translated into

signals to the bacteria they will behave

and then the bacteria will answer back

so for example it turns a little bit

into a a tamagi sort of thing because

you can can it can s you can sense when

it needs to be feeded when it is cold or

you know like whatever and you can sense

the differences in the answers by the

changes in the state of the bacteria

community so there is some research on

that on Multi interface communication Ai

and so on you I can I can point you to

to that later and for the other topics

uh I don't know if someone wants to say

something

yeah well I wanted to come about this

idea of recognition it's for me one of

the biggest misunderstandings about

intuition in because intuition is

mysterious because we don't know all the

element PL into the decision there is a

strong tendency to attribute it to

something super physical

paranormal

tathy vo

precognition actually precognition what

does precognition mean means that the

brain is predicting things or

anticipating

things on the basis of what

when it's in symbolic mode you can say I

predict that the dog will bar because I

know the dogs bark and when the postman

comes dogs get angry and they will start

to bark but you can predict something

without knowing why an example could

be you haven't seen a f for 10 years I'm

just thinking about my one day later he

it looks like

prion now of course lots of these things

are just coincidences whenever you

thought about your and he called it you

notice it whenever he told about your

and he didn't call forget about it but

maybe you picked up some things in the

backround that you wouldn't have noticed

maybe you heard from a friend of that F

who emailed you and the fact that that F

of a f emailed you was maybe because

there was some connection with this

other F that you haven't seen in in 10

years there can be all kind

of indications of something indication

about two we that are too

distributed and that suddenly make you

predict something like I see that this

is going to happen well much of the time

it wouldn't happen but sometimes it does

happen

w i i can I can see to the Future now if

it was really seeing into the future

then you should be able to test it and

the way to test it is to make people

predict random events like predict or

which number the r will come to stop now

if that ability would

exist then casinos would be losing a lot

of money and they're gaining a lot of

money

so when you do test where you let people

predict something that is s which mean

that it's not an indication anywhere

hidden in the world then yeah pay

condition doesn't seem to work when pay

condition works it's po because there

was some indication that your brain

subconsciously has picked up and made it

expect

from I said

St I have was I collect data and maybe I

like I not aware of it all I wouldn't

say calculated but you you're

subconscious what you

working and one of the one of the things

that makes it also serious is that some

people say that have a kind of a

scientific orical background they kind

of don't to think that they must reason

everything out in the system to more

explicit and by doing that they suing

the

intuition well there are states of

Consciousness in which your intuition is

much more free it's much less this voice

in your head is trying to function in

symbolic mode and because of that you

may be in a state of mind where your

inition functions more much better and

then you have the more kind of intuitive

people people typically with an art

background

typically they now it's tobly sexist St

but that's what used to be called female

intuition culturally women were supposed

to be more intuitive and sessional and

that me that women might up this small

indication that men who try to reduce

everything to verbal symbolic reasoning

may not and then yes they may be in the

State of Consciousness where the

intuition function but but of course it

does in any way guarantee that the end

will give you the right answer that is

no foolproof system intuition is the

brain's best attempt at predicting what

will happen the brain never have all the

information so you can never guarantee

effectiv when

AR I suggest I would appreciate if we

could somehow settle on a

stable definition of intuition which can

work here because you're sitting here I

think I can come up with about five

different inations we've talked about

within

the so what did you do was maybe this

thing that influenced me and something

from the past Etc so you just

the the intuition the

intuition yeah you see so I'm I'm a

little confused

here

the antic

process understand if I look and I try

to in the meantime find all kinds of

definitions of intuition where the

conclusion is included in the definition

I haven't been able to found one if I go

to the Oxford English Dictionary it says

the immediate apprehension of an object

by the mind without the intervention of

any reasoning

process well that's a far crime from

arriving living at a

conclusion see I mean if I say two plus

two is

four conclusion and I can show how I

arrived at it that I can arrive in an

apprehension of an object at an

impression as a Guess Word it seems to

me that way more likely than not but a

conclusion is a very definite thing

unless we want to somehow fudge that as

well and then I find myself losing it

because something just temporary meaning

if I could just finish for one second is

is intuition something temporary until I

analyze what

happened or does intuition

Define

analytics is it a different way to

arrive at a conclusion is is it the same

thing saying 2+ 2 is 4 is saying I have

a gut feeling that this roulette ball

will fall on the number 33 now if the

number 33 shows up people say how did

you do that and I might not be able to

explain it but are we not fudging things

here or kind of moving the goalpost by

equating certain things of saying well

this is an arrival at a conclusion by

different

means but then you proceeded to then

show us that he arrived by the

conclusion by the exact same means he

just didn't take the time to actually

analyze precisely the impetus he was

receiving from the environment had he

done so you said oh yeah I know this is

going to happen because this thing

reminded me of a colleague this my

neighbor said the dog

bar and that's what I'm trying to say

well to ask yeah yeah I mean the the the

example of artificial intelligence here

I think is Illuminating so let's take as

a model of intuition of con is Network

neural network let's take as a model of

of reasoning these knowledge based

expert systems that use for example per

per a language that is specifically made

just to formalize logical

reasoning what a neural network does is

it

takes hundreds thousands sometimes

millions of different things into

account that all have extremely small

effect and Al together make that a

particular conclusion is seen as more

likely than another

one you can't call that things you can

say okay yes there is that it hasn't

come out of

nowhere it has come out of something

that is so distributed so big so varable

that you can't say I can't explain it as

a logical stop because I expect let's

take my example of I see somebody

sitting there who isn't moving much and

who's looking like that and I think that

person look sad maybe he got some bad

news so that's an intui thing I don't

have a logical reason to say why this

person got bad

news then I may be right or I may be

wrong and quite likely that I'm right

I'm more likely to be right let's say

than that I randomly say something like

that

how did I come to that conclusion if you

would analyze everything that has

happened in my brain from watching that

person all the different things that I

paid attention to I wouldn't be able to

enumerate them they are there it's

not but you can't really reconstruct the

process as a number of logical steps you

can model simulator process with a

neural network if your new network is

big enough it has enough layers and it

has got enough data to search for like

TP then it can do this but chpt cannot

tell you why it gave you this particular

Als at this moment and another

off more precisely in

more changeable way of you know what

intuition is so I've had a lot of

experience with people who are commonly

believed to be experts and inition are

CH observed them I lived with

them been um initiated the hope you triy

to actually adopt is the correct word

and to me a lot what he did looked like

in but that's why I'm saying it's

subjective I was

knowledgeable to understand the sort of

complexities ad recognition songs the

things that they're looking for I was

like a blind man in a in a dark

c one of my my relatives there my

brother who is a Domin initiated ainaa

Society

in inopia reservation in

Arizona he took the time to explain to

me what was happening and why the result

was completely reliable

predictable so what for me looked like

intuition like like you know Master

Grand Master of intuition for him was no

you know if you pay attention to this

and this and this this all these

different

factors this is the result I

must sometimes you that's what I'm

trying

to sometimes you can sometimes you can't

and in in the early days of the expert

systems the bottleneck was how do we get

the knowledge from the expert into the

machine the expert would intuitively

tell you I have a

television uh I push a number of buttons

and I see certains ah I know that

transistor is broken and then they

thought okay that should be simple to

formalize so if this is so and that is

not so and that is then this this is

broken

so sometimes you can rules out of it in

other cases you can't get rules out of

it in the case of this television

probably even though the expert was

intuitively saying I think that

transistor will be broken you could

probably reduce it to a number of

logical steps in the case that the

example I gave about a person looking

sad it would be much more difficult to

give the RO but that does not mean that

the conclusion wouldn't be pretty

reliable

so some things I mean you could just see

in the number of factors and the

weakness of the links if there are few

factors with strongly that mean that if

a done 90% chance B if C done 90% chance

D then you can kind of reduce it to some

exper system but if it

is if a then 1% chance this if be then

1% chance of this and all of these

things are some of which are more active

than others and they all together the

activation spits and it converges to

some

conclusion yeah there are

thousand is there any other comment

because uh maybe very short last

intervention if anybody wants to say

something I have a one intervention okay

com

okay okay so

yeah what is your name mountain

mountain yeah um you were talking about

Buddhism that so you said that you're

that that what you are doing is based on

on Buddhism and I would say this is an

example for a backward reason you know

because uh because if you say um I'm I'm

uh my uh everything that I'm doing

artistically is based on the Buddhism

you have these uh steps so you know how

to proceed because you know what it

should not be so it should not be

conscious it should not be uh all that

all that that you count it in so you

have a very precise idea of uh what to

do and how so the result um is is that

whatever you do it has to be this as a

as a

result yeah um

so we will close the session now this

okay you want to say something okay yeah

we will gr the session but this is a

very special day because uh I need to

before we go on on on pause um we'll put

it here maybe people can see and we have

actually two people from our research

group uh coincidentally having her

birthday today

so one of them is Olivier who is here

K and the other is my gares who is

online so she's in Chile and and so I

will um propose that we sing the Happy

Birthday that for both of them so we say

happy birthday o and my okay one two

three happy birth

to

birth to

you

de birthday to

you beautiful so we will close the the

session and now we go for lunch all

together so once we close the I will

explain the details but for and and also

the little activity maybe people uh

connected online um please try to check

or select two or three concepts that

this morning were useful to you um and

so then you can share them with us I was

picking up some Concepts that were

interesting today like coincidence

backward and forward reasoning

predictive processing free

improvisations or price and equilibria

and there is this idea that I uh I I

have around that I want to explain later

or share which is the idea of nonlinear

knowledge which which I think is will

help out to to to go to clarify some of

the intuitions we have about intuition

so yeah let's go for lunch and we can

pause the recording time we come back we

come back at

230 230 we back from zo 2:30 we're back

zo I

won't oh

yeah so we lock this door take

everything with us uh we

we can lo yeah we have a key I will ask

security

yeah
