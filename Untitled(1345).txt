Peanut Butter and Jam Pad Thai

### Ingredients:

- Rice noodles
- Peanut butter
- Olive oil
- Sesame oil
- Fried tofu
- Cumin
- Cilantro
- Lime
- Ketchup
- Jam (preferably a fruit variety like apricot for a hint of sweetness)
- Dijon mustard
- Soy sauce
- Sweet chili sauce
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Nutritional yeast
- A fried tortilla (for serving)

### Instructions:

#### Prepare the Noodles:
1. Cook rice noodles according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain and set aside.

#### Make the Sauce:
2. In a bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of cumin, the juice of 1 lime, 2 tablespoons of ketchup, 1 tablespoon of jam, 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.

#### Cook the Tofu:
3. If not already fried, heat a skillet over medium heat with a mix of olive oil and sesame oil. Fry tofu cubes until golden brown. Season with a little soy sauce and cumin for extra flavor.

#### Combine:
4. In a large pan, heat a small amount of olive oil over medium heat. Add the cooked noodles and the sauce, tossing well to coat the noodles evenly. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the noodles are heated through and have absorbed the sauce.

5. Add the fried tofu to the pan and gently mix to combine. Allow to cook for another minute.

#### Garnish and Serve:
6. Transfer the Pad Thai to a serving plate. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds, a generous amount of nutritional yeast (for a cheesy, nutty flavor), and finely chopped cilantro over the top.

7. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over and a side of fried tortilla for added crunch.
