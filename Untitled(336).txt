Lateral thinking: A problem solving method that involves looking for solutions in unconventional or indirect ways.

Random stimulation: A method that involves exposing oneself to random stimuli in order to generate new ideas and connections.

Metaphor: This approach involves using comparisons or analogies to help frame and understand a problem, and to generate new solutions by drawing connections to other domains.

Random word generation: This method involves generating random words or phrases and using them as inspiration for new ideas and solutions.

Forced connections: This approach involves intentionally making connections between seemingly unrelated concepts or domains, in order to stimulate creative thinking and generate new solutions.

Synectics: This method involves using techniques such as analogies, metaphors, and imaginative scenarios to stimulate creative thinking and generate new solutions.

Anticonventional thinking: This approach involves intentionally breaking the rules, challenging assumptions, and questioning conventional wisdom, in order to generate new and unconventional solutions to problems.


Provocation: A method that involves deliberately challenging existing assumptions in order to generate new ideas.

Reverse engineering: A method that involves working backwards from the desired solution to find a path to the solution.

Absurdities: A method that involves using humor or absurdity to provoke new ways of thinking.

Concept mapping: A method that involves creating a visual representation of the relationships between concepts in order to better understand a problem.
