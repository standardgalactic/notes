I thought that it was predated by Swedeborg who argued that heaven itself was in the shape of a body, similar to the Christian notion of the body of Christ, where different people play different roles similar to different cellular functions or organs.

of taith more than the conviction of reason. He wanted to call
the universe the pluriverse. In his own psychological experiments,
James was drawn to the phenomena that this mental reductionism
ignored. What parts of the mind cannot be measured?
Searching for the immeasurable led James directly to the ques-
tion of feeling. Our subjective emotions, he said, were the "unscien-
tific half of existence."" Because we only experienced the feeling as a
conscious whole-and not as a sum of separate sensations -to
As a pragmatist, James also believed that fcelings- and not some sort of pure Cartesian
reason-were the motivation behind most of our beliefs. In ""The Will to Believe," James
remarked that "these feelings of our duty about either truth or error are in any case only
expressions of our passional lifc.. Objective evidence and certitude are doubtless very
fine ideals to play with, but where on this moonlit and dream-visited planet are they
found?" Although James's essay sparked a firestorm of controversy, he was really just tak-
ing David Hume's claim that *reason is and ought to be, the slave of the passions" to its
logical conclusion.

break the emotion apart (as science tried to do) was to make it un-
real. "The demand for atoms of feeling," James wrote, "seems d
sheer vagary, an illegitimate metaphor. Rationally, we see what per-
plexities it brings in train; and empirically, no fact suggests it, for
the actual content of our minds are always representations of some
kind of ensemble."
Ensemble is the key word here. As Whitman had written thirty
years before, "I will not make poems with reference to parts / But I
will make poems with reference to ensemble"

When James intro-
spected, he realized that Whitman's poetry revealed an essential
truth: our feelings emerge from the interactions of the brain and
the body, not from any single place in either one.

This is an article from the Lone Hand written by L. Woolacott in 1920 that discusses the idea of "wordless, imageless thought." The author argues that there are emotional impulses towards right action that can occur without the need for verbal expression or thought images.

These impulses come from a deeper level of the mind and should be obeyed without hesitation.

The article also discusses the idea that the mind is not a collection of separate powers, but one power using the entire body as its instrument.

The author suggests that as people become more educated in psychology, a new terminology will be needed to describe mental operations, and current terms like "conscience," "intelligence," "will," and "reason" will fall into disuse.

Source: Wordless Imageless Thought

Ernest Osborne’s short article on “Thought” in the Lone Hand for June provoked a two-hour long discussion among some of my friends. The main conclusions are here concentrated for you:

If wordless, imageless thought be a possibility, is it not a further argument for obeying the inhibitions of conscience without waiting until the inhibitory impulses can be put into words?

For instance, if one becomes conscious of an uneasy feeling when one is about to do a certain action, would it not be better to avoid doing the action even if one cannot put into words the reason why the action should be avoided?

There are unmistakable emotional impulses towards right action which occur periodically and which we should train ourselves to obey unhesitatingly.

No time should be spent in seeking a logical reason for the impulses. Obey them. You know they are right—right for you at any rate.

This knowledge at critical moments of what is right and wrong is an instance of thought unclothed with words.

Such knowledge springs from a level of the mind deeper than the layer on which operate thought-images, combined with the capability of verbal expression.
 
When the deeper levels of the mind operate harmoniously with the outermost layer (we took McDougall as our authority for speaking of mental “layers” and “levels”), then only is a man at peace with himself and the universe.

For him the paradox, "Right speech is right action", is no longer a paradox. The majority of us are unhappily crammed with Freudian complexes which make harmonious speech and action nearly impossible. Hence the saying, “He acted against his better self.”

Translated into modern psychological terms the phrase would read, “The layers of his mind were not acting in unity.”  

After the masses are sufficiently educated, a new terminolgy for mental operations will have to come into being.

Such psychically identical terms as “conscience,” “intelligence,” “will,” and “reason,” will fall as far into the limbo of  
disuse as such words as “humours” and “faculties” have already fallen.

The greatest lesson of modern psychology is that the mind is not a concatenation of separate powers, but one power using as its instrument the whole body.

— L. Woolacott, 1920

You might be envisioning a universe where geometries shape probabilities (Geometric Bayesianism), structures are fundamentally hexahedral (Hexahedral Dynamics), long-term behaviors have ergodic properties that influence cognitive processes (Ergodic Mind Medication), and consciousness or information processing isn't tied to specific substrates (SITH theory).

* * *
The line about no poems about parts but only about ensembles, reminds me of my job title as a mereological space ontologist, and made me think of the claim in SITH theory that termite mounds and beehives are more conscious then bees or termites, as a human is more conscious than their organs and their organs than their cells (Levin's multiscale polycomputation). SITH theory might argue that planetary ecosystems and cities are more conscious than the individual humans, since it has more perceptual control over its environment, but that consciousness and intelligence are not equivalent so bees and humans have more intelligence individually then their collective consciousness.

Here is a refresher on SITH theory:

Here's a summary of the basic tenets of the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) model, along with a comparison and contrast with other prominent models of consciousness.

SITH Model:

Collective Consciousness: Consciousness can emerge from complex systems like beehives or termite mounds, not necessarily 
from individual entities.

Consciousness as a Scale Difference: Consciousness is seen as a spectrum where even simple structures can exhibit control over their environment, with complex beings like humans being further along this spectrum.

Physical Objects as Memory and Calculations: Physical structures can serve functions typically associated with cognition, such as memory and calculations, linking consciousness with physical processes.

Comparison with Other Models:

Global Workspace Theory (GWT):

SITH: Emphasizes the collective and physical structures, suggesting even non-biological systems could be conscious.

GWT: Focuses on a "workspace" in the brain where information becomes 

conscious by being globally available to various cognitive processes.

Contrast: SITH takes a more decentralized and non-biological view, whereas GWT is specifically brain-centered.

Integrated Information Theory (IIT):

SITH: Argues that consciousness can arise from physical interactions and collective behaviors, even in non-human systems like termite mounds.

IIT: Proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information within a system and that even simple systems can have a degree of consciousness

Similarity: Both models recognize the potential for consciousness in non-human systems but differ in how they define and measure this.

Embodied Cognition:

SITH: Aligns with the idea that consciousness can arise from physical processes and collective interactions, extending even to non-living systems.

Embodied Cognition: Stresses the importance of the body 
and environment in shaping cognitive processes.

Similarity: Both emphasize the role of physical structure and environment but differ in scope, with SITH including non-biological structures.

Higher-Order Thought Theories:

SITH: Focuses on system-level processes and collective behaviors, not necessarily requiring self-reflection or higher-order thoughts.

Higher-Order Thought Theories: Emphasize the role of reflective self-awareness in consciousness.

Contrast: SITH's focus on collective behaviors and physical processes contrasts with the introspective and self-aware nature of higher-order thought theories.

In summary, the SITH model introduces a novel view of consciousness, emphasizing collective interactions and the potential for consciousness in
non-biological systems.

It shares some similarities with theories like IIT and embodied cognition but contrasts sharply with models centered on individual brains or introspective thinking.

Its emphasis on the physical embodiment of cognitive functions and the recognition of consciousness in unexpected places sets it apart from many traditional theories.
