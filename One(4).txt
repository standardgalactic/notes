I see, so the purpose of UM1 is to classify messages and detect similarity between pairs of messages, in this case questions. It does not perform question answering but rather uses Jaccard Similarity to compare the encoded meaning of the questions represented by their moniforms. The encoding is performed by the understanding algorithm, Organic Learning, which maps each input character to an Input Node and represents the understanding of the text as a list of numbers, the moniform. The encoding is performed by the understanding algorithm, Organic Learning, which maps each input character to an Input Node and represents the understanding of the text as a list of numbers, the moniform. The moniforms are stored in a table and used to compare with incoming messages to find the best match.

A summary of this conversation.

In this conversation, we discussed the development of an algorithm called UM1 and its underlying concept, Organic Learning (OL). UM1 is designed to understand text inputs and classify them based on their semantics. The algorithm uses a table that maps each different UNICODE input character to a specific Node in the Understander, and generates a list of numbers, called a "moniform". The moniform is compared to a probe table built when the client system starts, using Jaccard Similarity as the distance measure. The ID numbers in the moniform represent dimensions in a boolean semantic space, and Jaccard distance is used to determine the closest matching moniform in the probe table. The goal of UM1 is to classify messages and is not a question-answering system. The concept of UM1 is discussed in more detail at https://experimental-epistemology.ai.

Organic Learning, also known as Monica's Connectome Algorithm, is a unique type of machine learning system that focuses on processing sequences of data and efficiently tracking correlations within the data. The algorithm starts with an empty network and builds up a connectome, a graph of nodes and links that represent the experiences it encounters. Unlike Deep Learning, which requires multiple passes through the entire processing stack to discover correlations, Organic Learning only needs to perform the correlation discovery once and then represents the correlations with persistent Synapse-like links. This means that Organic Learning systems are more efficient and do not require explicit attention mechanisms.

Organic Learning also employs a concept known as Neural Darwinism, which evaluates the relevance of different parts of the Connectome from millisecond to millisecond. The best ideas in the network are rewarded and the less useful ideas are punished through reinforcement learning (RL). Additionally, the best ideas are allowed to breed with other good ideas to produce even better abstractions, speeding up the learning process. This is similar to sexual reproduction in nature and allows multiple inventions to merge into a single better solution.

This means that after processing 10 million characters of text data, the learning algorithm generates a file that describes the connections between different nodes in the network. This file, known as a "node wiring list," represents the knowledge that has been acquired through the process. This knowledge can then be loaded into the Natural Language Understanding Service as the foundation for further processing and understanding.

Organic Learning (OL) is a type of machine learning that is designed for processing sequential data, such as natural language text. In contrast to deep learning, which uses convolutions to discover correlations in image data, OL uses a discrete neural network where each character read from the input stream activates a character input neuron, and this cascade of signaling determines both the meaning of the sentence and where to attach any new understanding learned from that character. This incremental attachment operation is what provides the "organic growth" in the system.

An OL system operates character by character, which means it can learn languages that do not use segmented words, such as Chinese. The system creates a "node wiring list" as its main output, which describes the connections between neurons. This competence creation event is typically scheduled after a certain amount of corpus has been processed, and the competence file can be loaded to re-create the learned neural structure and be used as the basis of the Natural Language Understanding Service.
