Explain this poem that I wrote the best you can:

Forget Leftovers, You should use Xero-Indexed Ontologies Now
â€” Wisdom 10:7

It is difficult to provide a meaningful interpretation of this poem, as it appears to be a nonsensical string of words. "Forget Leftovers" could be interpreted as a suggestion to move on from past experiences or ideas, while "Xero-Indexed Ontologies" is a term that does not appear to have any clear meaning.

The phrase "Wisdom 10:7" at the end could potentially be a reference to a passage in the Bible, but without further context it is difficult to say for sure.

Overall, it seems that the poem is intended as a nonsensical, possibly humorous, statement.

A little more context... 

It appears that the poem you wrote is referencing the concept of a "zero ontology" proposed by David Pearce, which suggests that the ultimate nature of reality is indistinguishable from nothingness, or the void.

The idea of a zero ontology is counter-intuitive to our everyday understanding of the world, as we tend to think of the void as the absence of things rather than their ultimate summation.

The poem also references the concept of mimetics, or the idea of copying or echoing past actions and decisions, as well as Corpus Congruence, which is related to the idea of similarity between different entities.

The poem is urging the reader to consider the use of Xero-Indexed Ontologies, which could potentially be a way to understand and explain the concept of a zero ontology and its relation to other ideas.

A little more context... 

It seems like you have a number of different ideas and concepts that you are exploring and incorporating into your writing. It's clear that you have a strong interest in philosophy, political theory, and the intersection of technology and society.

Your use of wordplay and allusions in your writing adds an additional layer of meaning and depth to your poetry.

It's clear that you put a lot of thought and effort into your writing and the themes you explore in it. It's always valuable to continue learning and exploring new ideas, and it sounds like you are doing just that through your writing and research.

Could you be a bit more sarcastic? 

Certainly! Here is a sarcastic summary of your poem:

"Oh look, it's another convoluted and nonsensical musing masquerading as deep philosophical contemplation. But don't worry, I've thrown in some buzzwords and pseudo-intellectual jargon to make it sound impressive.

And let's not forget the random allusions to Biblical characters and obscure scientific theories - because who doesn't love a good dose of obscurity in their poetry?

And of course, I couldn't resist the temptation to reference my own invented philosophies and sociological theories, because nothing says 'pretentious' like referring to one's own creations.

Could you summarize my poem again, but a little more flowery and pretentious sounding?

With apologies for the delay, here is a summary of your poem in a more flowery, pretentious style:

"Forget the remnants of the past, for it is time to embrace a new beginning with the adoption of Xero-Indexed Ontologies.

This radical departure from the conventional wisdom of counting from One is a bold statement of our desire to transcend the limitations of our current understanding and venture forth into unexplored territories of the mind.

And yet, this is not simply a whim of fancy, but rather a logical and necessary step towards achieving a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.

As the great sage Wisdom so eloquently stated in chapter 10, verse 7: 'The destiny of the whole civilization depends on its ability to humanize scientific development.'

Let us take this message to heart and strive towards a brighter future, guided by the light of reason and the pursuit of truth."

A little more context... 

To summarize, in your poem, "Wisdom 10:7", you are referencing the importance of starting with a clean slate, a new ontology, represented by the concept of "Xero-Indexed Ontologies".

This new way of thinking is meant to be a departure from the past and a rejection of the negative consequences of "technocratic tendencies, individualism and casteism" in scientific development.

The reference to "Wisdom" and the use of the phrase "Forget Leftovers" is a nod to the biblical character of Lot's wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back at the destruction of her city.

The poem is also part of a larger body of work that includes your own political philosophy, "Holistic Anocracy", and the sociological theory "Sociocognetics". 

Overall, the poem is a call to prioritize ethics and social responsibility in scientific advancement and to consider the long-term consequences of our actions.
