Certainly! Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:

1. Stone Piano Theory
2. Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)
3. Bayesian Learning Mechanisms
   - Bayesian belief updating
   - Reinforcement learning
   - Bayesian model comparison
4. The relevance and potential integration of various theories
5. The concept of thinking like a Neanderthal
6. Thomas Nagel's philosophical thought on "What is it like to be a bat?"
7. Your personal inventions and languages: ANAK (a new Arabic keyboard), spherepop, pipsqueak, and Ankyran Nuspeak.
8. The idea of counterfoil choices, especially in the context of the Kalabari culture.
9. Connections between the Kalabari counterfoil choices and the misuse of IQ scores, with analogies to the Icarus myth and the Tower of Babel.
10. Faulty Self-Assessment as discussed in the paper by Travis J. Carter and David Dunning.
11. An honest test for intelligence and its various categories.
12. Proposed name: Multiscale Intelligence Test (MIT) and discussions related to its normalization and standard deviation.

This is a broad overview, and each topic had sub-discussions and nuances. Would you like to explore any of these further or move on to a new topic?

Could I get a kind of example test with subquestions for each category?

Certainly! Here's a sample test based on the categories you've proposed:

---

### **1. Mimicry and Imitation**
* Imitate the call of a common bird. (e.g., a crow, sparrow, or owl)
* Replicate the walk of a four-legged animal. (e.g., a cat, dog, or horse)

### **2. Auditory and Visual Creativity**
* Using only your hands, create three distinct sounds.
* Make five unique gestures that could be used to convey different emotions or messages without words.

### **3. Communication**
* Describe a sunset to someone who's never seen one before.
* Tell a brief story where the main character undergoes a significant transformation.

### **4. Abstract Thinking**
* If "A" stands for 1, "B" stands for 2, and so on, what would the sum be for the word "CAB"?
* Create a simple code where symbols replace certain words and write a sentence using it.

### **5. Identity and Self-awareness**
* Describe an event from your past that significantly shaped who you are today.
* If you were to represent your life with three symbols, what would they be and why?

### **6. Problem Solving for Global Challenges**
* Propose a simple method to reduce household energy consumption.
* Design a community initiative to raise awareness about the effects of sea-level rise.

### **7. Future Planning and Prevention**
* Describe a potential extinction-level event and propose a solution to prevent or mitigate its effects.
* How might urban planning evolve to anticipate and respond to increasing natural disasters?

### **8. Innovation**
* Design a device or tool that can make daily commuting more efficient.
* Propose a dietary change or meal plan that could significantly increase human lifespan.

This test attempts to span various skills and forms of intelligence. Some questions require creativity, others factual knowledge or analytical thinking, and others introspection and personal reflection. The answers could be assessed based on clarity, creativity, feasibility, and depth of understanding.
