Rhyzomatic scaling is a concept derived from the idea of rhizomes, which are complex, branching root systems found in plants. In the context of knowledge and information, rhyzomatic scaling refers to the exponential increase in the number of connections and potential pathways that become available as the scale of the problem or the amount of information being considered grows.

For example, when dealing with a small amount of information, the number of possible connections and pathways to explore may be limited. But as the amount of information grows, the potential number of connections between pieces of information can quickly become too vast for any individual to fully comprehend or analyze. Rhyzomatic scaling is the idea that as a system becomes more complex, it becomes more difficult to fully understand and navigate all of its potential connections and pathways.
