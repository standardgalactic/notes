Isn't there a connection between
the Enc() and a(, s( for
attention? I think that it would be
peneficial to be biased on things
related to the last action made
especially if x(t) is humongous in
size (vision+sound+internalised
tokens)

From what I understand you trying
to say that LLM is less powerfull
in some sense, but it looks like it
just question of definitions
State can be anything, if you ask
LLM to track state of the world

ChatGPT
It's great that Mary visited you and enjoyed an apple! With your iPhone at only 10% battery, it would
be a good idea to charge it soon to ensure it remains functional, especially if you're expecting
more visits or need to use it later.
State of the world: User bought 5 apples today. Mary visited and ate 1 apple. User's iPhone battery
is at 10%.

ChatGPT
Charging your iPhone for 5 hours should have significantly replenished its battery,likely bringing it
to a full charge or close to it, depending on the charger and the iPhone model.

 Enjoy your meal
from the fridge! If you have any questions or need assistance with something else, feel free to ask.
