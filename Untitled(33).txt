Why society hates creative people. Well, society doesn't hate creative people so much as ignore them.

With the exception of a tiny percentage of superstars, whose creativity is celebrated.

Since there is no objective way to evaluate creative works, people judge the quality of works by how much money it makes, and how popular it is -- how many people have heard about it.

In business, however, when businesses hire creative people for design work, their highest priority is predictability/reducing risk.

 Many businesses profess commitment to "innovation" but it's not really true. Most truly groundbreaking creative work is done by people with "nothing to lose" -- people who are "outsiders" relative to the "successful" people of their field at the time. Ironically once these people become successful, they often become less creative, resorting to incremental improvements to the "winning formula" that they discovered.

In the "and what to do about it" part of the video, he (John Mauriello) suggests techniques to help you focus on and continue to improve your creative craft irrespective of whether any of your results make money or not.

Studies have shown that focusing on money actually reduces creativity. It's helpful for designers to have side projects where they can get feedback from friends or other designers and not have the pressure of money or popularity involved.
