You wet a piece of paper, crumple it into a ball, roll it up into a ball, cover it with saw dust and spray it with resin, if you want to read what is on the paper, you scan it with a low energy microwave or xray and then reconstruct it using machine learning and origamy folding algorithms, I know it sounds crazy and like a lot of extra work.
