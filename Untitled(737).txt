A very minor argument over semantics. They don't "read" and they don't "think" in the same way as humans.

They do things that would be called hallucinations if they were from a human being. They say untrue things, but act like they "believe" they are real, giving all kinds of justifications for them.

They aren't "bullshitting" either, which is usually a synonym for "lying," as they don't understand what they are doing, which they would have to be in order for it to be truly lying.

If I say, "Give me a summary of this conversation," and it adds something we didn't talk about and justifies it when questioned, that is the exact same thing as what we call a hallucination or a false memory.

We call that a hallucination in ordinary language as well; we don't have to make the claim that the other person is actually seeing or hearing it. It is often just the same as saying that they are adding something that wasn't stated.

I think the author is hallucinating when they claim that the word "hallucination" is incorrect.

We are comparing them to old programs that did exactly what you asked them. When you do it with images, it looks like a human hallucination.

When I ask something, and it throws something in that I didn't ask for, or it grows an arm out of the side of someone's head, that is what we would normally call a hallucination.

Of course, we are taking an intentional stance in order to claim that they are "reading" documents or making "arguments" for things in the first place.

Rather than reject the word hallucination (for some pedantic and inexplicable reason), we could say that even its correct answers are hallucinations, since they do not correspond to a perceptual stimulus.

It seems like a very minor point; everyone knows what the word "hallucinate" means, and it seems they are using the term appropriately.

It means to make up something that isn't real but act as if it is.
