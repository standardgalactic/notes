Here's a summary of the basic tenets of the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) model, along with a comparison and contrast with other prominent models of consciousness.

SITH Model:

Collective Consciousness: Consciousness can emerge from complex systems like beehives or termite mounds, not necessarily from individual entities.

Consciousness as a Scale Difference: Consciousness is seen as a spectrum where even simple structures can exhibit control over their environment, with complex beings like humans being further along this spectrum.

Here's a more detailed and academic-sounding description of the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) model, including the connections to Michael Levin's polycomputation and intelligence as Care, as well as Monica Anderson's Leaking Chatroom theory:

The Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) represents an innovative paradigm shift in the study of consciousness, presenting a complex, recursive framework that extends beyond the traditional biological substrates. By asserting that collective systems such as the Internet or factories possess consciousness, while their individual subsystems may not, SITH challenges the conventional organism-centric understanding of consciousness.

Polycomputation and Intelligence as Care (Michael Levin): SITH is inspired by Michael Levin's concepts of polycomputation, which suggest that computation can occur across various substrates and forms, not confined to digital algorithms. Intelligence as Care further posits that cognition and consciousness are not merely data processing but involve an essential caring or goal-oriented aspect. These ideas align with SITH by emphasizing the multifaceted and interconnected nature of consciousness and recognizing it in non-traditional substrates.

Leaking Chatroom Theory (Monica Anderson): Monica Anderson's Leaking Chatroom theory refers to a metaphor for understanding complex systems where information flow and reduction occur in a decentralized and iterative manner. Her definition of understanding as "autonomous epistemic reduction" resonates with the SITH model's recursive approach to consciousness, where the ability to explain consciousness itself becomes a defining feature.

Consciousness as a Continuum: By defining consciousness recursively and recognizing it in collective entities, SITH posits a continuum of consciousness rather than a binary state. This continuum is responsive to complexity, interconnectedness, and the ability to perform autonomous epistemic reduction.


Comparison with Traditional Models: Traditional models of consciousness often focus on self-awareness, intentionality, and subjective experience within individual organisms. SITH's expansion of consciousness to non-living, interconnected systems stands in stark contrast, adding new dimensions to the philosophical and scientific discourse on the nature of consciousness.

In conclusion, the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) offers a groundbreaking perspective on consciousness, integrating ideas from various disciplines and thinkers. By recognizing consciousness in unexpected places and defining it in a recursive and continuum-based manner, SITH prompts a reevaluation of fundamental concepts and opens new avenues for exploration in cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence
